INTRODUCTION O

One B-DATE
day I-DATE
in O
my O
wanderings O
in O
that B-DATE
quarter I-DATE
of O
the O
city O
of O
Tokio B-ORG
given O
up O
to O
the O
habitation O
of O
the O
poorer O
classes O
of O
the O
community O
, O
I O
stopped O
to O
rest O
for O
a O
moment O
at O
the O
lowly O
hut O
of O
an O
old O
jinrikisha O
man O
whom O
I O
had O
had O
frequent O
occasion O
to O
employ O
theretofore O
. O

Finding O
the O
old O
man O
and O
his O
wife O
at O
home O
, O
I O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
porch O
, O
and O
after O
a O
while O
succeeded O
in O
drawing O
the O
couple O
into O
something O
like O
conversation O
. O

The O
hut O
which O
they O
occupied O
was O
poor O
enough O
. O

It O
stood O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
a O
small O
sweet O
- O
potato O
field O
, O
and O
contained O
only B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
rooms O
, O
the O
floor O
of O
each O
one O
covered O
by O
two B-CARDINAL
mats O
of O
the O
usual O
size O
, O
and O
therefore O
exactly O
six B-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
square I-QUANTITY
. O

The O
extreme O
cleanliness O
of O
the O
place O
— O
although O
this O
quality O
in O
general O
is O
common O
in O
Japan B-GPE
— O
struck O
me O
at O
once O
, O
in O
spite O
, O
or O
partly O
on O
account O
, O
of O
the O
extreme O
poverty O
, O
which O
was O
equally O
evident O
. O

The O
sliding O
paper O
- O
covered O
doors O
, O
which O
also O
served O
as O
windows O
, O
had O
been O
taken O
out O
, O
and O
I O
could O
look O
through O
the O
house O
, O
which O
contained O
nothing O
in O
the O
way O
of O
furniture O
, O
not O
even O
a O
pine O
cloth O
- O
chest O
such O
as O
is O
seldom O
lacking O
in O
the O
poorest O
habitations O
— O
nothing O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
except O
a O
few O
patched O
cotton O
quilts O
which O
served O
for O
beds O
, O
bedding O
, O
and O
covering O
, O
rolled O
up O
in O
a O
corner O
. O

The O
thick O
straw O
mats O
, O
although O
their O
outside O
covering O
was O
in O
part O
worn O
off O
by O
use O
, O
showed O
not O
a O
speck O
of O
dirt O
or O
dust O
, O
and O
the O
bare O
upright O
timbers O
were O
perfectly O
white O
from O
frequent O
washing O
and O
scrubbing O
. O

Noticing O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
side O
of O
the O
room O
an O
old O
sword O
hanging O
on O
two B-CARDINAL
wooden O
pegs O
, O
I O
asked O
to O
be O
allowed O
to O
look O
at O
it O
, O
and O
it O
was O
rather O
hesitatingly O
, O
as O
I O
thought O
, O
handed O
to O
me O
. O

In O
former O
years B-DATE
only O
the O
samurai O
, O
or O
men O
of O
gentle O
blood O
, O
were O
allowed O
to O
wear O
two B-CARDINAL
swords O
, O
and O
always O
did O
so O
. O

They O
esteemed O
this O
as O
their O
most O
prized O
prerogative O
, O
and O
guarded O
the O
privilege O
with O
extreme O
jealousy O
as O
long O
as O
they O
enjoyed O
it O
, O
which O
was O
until O
the O
Government O
prohibited O
the O
practice O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O

The O
mere O
possession O
of O
a O
sword O
is O
now O
free O
to O
everybody O
, O
and O
many O
tens B-CARDINAL
of I-CARDINAL
thousands I-CARDINAL
of O
these O
weapons O
at O
present O
serve O
for O
fish O
and O
kitchen O
knives O
, O
or O
for O
other O
common O
purposes O
. O

Drawing O
this O
one O
from O
its O
wooden O
scabbard O
, O
I O
found O
it O
bright O
and O
shining O
; O
and O
being O
an O
amateur O
collector O
, O
I O
could O
see O
that O
it O
was O
no O
ordinary O
blade O
. O

“ O
Who O
is O
the O
maker O
? O
” O

I O
asked O
, O
almost O
mechanically O
, O
as O
I O
usually O
did O
when O
my O
Japanese B-NORP
friends O
favored O
me O
with O
a O
sight O
of O
their O
old O
family O
swords O
. O

The O
answer O
came O
very O
slowly O
, O
and O
not O
until O
an O
inquiring O
glance O
showed O
that O
I O
was O
surprised O
at O
not O
getting O
it O
sooner O
: O
“ O
It O
is O
a O
Muramasa B-PERSON
blade O
, O
your O
honor O
. O
” O

“ O
A O
Muramasa B-PERSON
! O
” O

I O
exclaimed O
, O
jumping O
up O
in O
genuine O
surprise O
; O
“ O
and O
how O
in O
the O
name O
of O
Buddha B-PERSON
did O
you O
manage O
to O
get O
hold O
of O
a O
Muramasa B-PERSON
? O
” O

My O
astonishment O
was O
natural O
. O

I O
had O
in O
the O
course O
of O
years B-DATE
succeeded O
in O
making O
a O
collection O
of O
swords O
of O
the O
best O
makers O
; O
but O
it O
was O
only O
after O
a O
long O
search O
, O
and O
at O
an O
expense O
which O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
considerable O
even O
by O
an O
ardent O
amateur O
like O
myself O
, O
that O
I O
had O
been O
able O
to O
acquire O
an O
undoubted O
and O
genuine O
piece O
of O
handiwork O
of O
the O
artisan O
who O
, O
with O
the O
single O
exception O
perhaps O
of O
Masamune B-ORG
, O
was O
certainly O
the O
most O
celebrated O
sword B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
smith I-PERSON
of O
Japan B-GPE
. O

“ O
It O
has O
been O
in O
the O
possession O
of O
my O
family O
, O
your O
honor O
, O
for O
five B-DATE
centuries I-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE
— O
ever O
since O
it O
was O
given O
by O
the O
maker O
who O
forged O
it O
, O
Senjuin B-PERSON
Muramasa I-PERSON
, O
to O
one O
of O
my O
ancestors O
at O
Ise B-ORG
, O
the O
place O
where O
they O
both O
resided O
. O
” O

The O
man O
’s O
voice O
, O
although O
, O
as O
heretofore O
, O
humbly O
polite O
in O
its O
manner O
, O
had O
now O
a O
new O
ring O
— O
something O
like O
a O
tone O
of O
cold O
formality O
; O
such O
a O
tone O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
, O
as O
might O
have O
characterized O
the O
voice O
of O
a O
polished O
Greek B-NORP
slave O
replying O
to O
some O
coarse O
word O
of O
his O
brutal O
Roman B-NORP
master O
. O

There O
was O
a O
pause O
of O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
moments I-TIME
, O
which O
the O
thought O
of O
my O
abrupt O
rudeness O
rendered O
awkward O
and O
even O
painful O
to O
me O
. O

I O
was O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
to O
break O
the O
silence O
, O
addressing O
him O
in O
the O
language O
which O
is O
used O
among O
equals O
, O
instead O
of O
, O
as O
heretofore O
, O
employing O
such O
terms O
as O
are O
used O
to O
inferiors O
— O
a O
distinction O
which O
in O
Japanese B-NORP
is O
strongly O
and O
definitely O
marked O
. O

I O
could O
see O
by O
a O
quick O
, O
startled O
movement O
, O
as O
well O
as O
by O
the O
play O
of O
his O
features O
, O
that O
the O
change O
was O
deeply O
felt O
, O
and O
the O
motive O
which O
prompted O
it O
appreciated O
. O

“ O
I O
have O
for O
years B-DATE
been O
a O
student O
of O
sword O
- O
lore O
, O
” O
I O
said O
, O
“ O
and O
I O
know O
that O
every O
Muramasa B-PERSON
blade O
has O
a O
history O
of O
its O
own O
, O
fraught O
with O
numerous O
romantic O
and O
thrilling O
incidents O
. O

This O
one O
here O
must O
have O
had O
its O
share O
, O
with O
which O
, O
under O
the O
circumstances O
, O
you O
are O
doubtless O
familiar O
; O
and O
I O
should O
esteem O
it O
a O
great O
favor O
to O
be O
permitted O
to O
listen O
to O
any O
narrative O
you O
may O
choose O
to O
recall O
, O
more O
especially O
as O
regards O
the O
time O
when O
the O
smith B-PERSON
was O
yet O
alive O
. O
” O

I O
had O
touched O
a O
sympathetic O
chord O
in O
the O
old O
man O
’s O
heart O
by O
this O
concession O
alike O
to O
his O
family O
pride O
and O
his O
love O
for O
the O
sword O
. O

It O
is O
not O
easy O
for O
a O
foreigner O
to O
understand O
how O
completely O
the O
sword O
has O
entered O
into O
Japanese B-NORP
life O
. O

Poets O
and O
minstrels O
, O
warriors O
and O
statesmen O
, O
lord O
and O
vassal O
, O
have O
honored O
it O
in O
word O
and O
deed O
for O
more B-DATE
than I-DATE
a I-DATE
millennium I-DATE
. O

To O
a O
greater O
extent O
than O
any O
other O
agent O
, O
probably O
, O
it O
has O
moulded O
and O
shaped O
the O
history O
of O
that O
country O
into O
its O
setting O
of O
gallant O
chivalry O
and O
self O
- O
immolating O
feudal O
devotedness O
, O
and O
has O
written O
its O
record O
on O
thousands B-CARDINAL
of O
well O
- O
contested O
battle O
- O
fields O
, O
in O
the O
quivering O
body O
of O
a O
living O
book O
. O

Only O
within O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
has O
it O
begun O
to O
outlive O
its O
power O
; O
but O
its O
renown O
is O
imperishable O
. O

The O
story O
told O
by O
this O
poor O
jinrikisha O
man O
, O
as O
we O
sat O
on O
the O
porch O
of O
his O
humble O
dwelling O
, O
constitutes O
but O
one B-CARDINAL
simple O
chapter O
in O
this O
wonderful O
history O
. O

It O
illustrates O
the O
spirit O
which O
pervaded O
Old B-LOC
Japan I-LOC
, O
the O
veneration O
which O
attached O
to O
the O
sword O
, O
and O
the O
peculiar O
personal O
obligations O
of O
honor O
which O
rested O
upon O
all O
samurai O
in O
those O
feudal O
times O
. O

As O
the O
story O
was O
related O
to O
me O
, O
so O
I O
tell O
it O
here O
, O
regretting O
only O
that O
in O
the O
process O
of O
translation O
it O
must O
lose O
much O
of O
local O
color O
and O
characterization O
, O
but O
hoping O
that O
in O
spite O
of O
this O
it O
may O
be O
found O
to O
possess O
an O
interest O
purely O
its O
own O
, O
independent O
of O
the O
way O
in O
which O
it O
is O
now O
narrated O

1322 O

For O

year O

All O
such O
disturbances O
, O
however O
, O
originating O
in O
private O
jealousy O

personal O
enmity O

had O
during O

in O

when O
one B-CARDINAL

During O

the O

both O

Plenty O

it O

by O
those O

the O

Kuwana B-PERSON

a O

for O

When O

Now O

for O
they O
all O
knew O
that O
the O

in O
the O

followed O
the O

to O
the O

when O

was O
pressed O
as O
a O

had O
by O
personal O
bravery O
and O
native O
force O
of O
character O
raised O
himself O
to O
the O
position O
of O
a O
military O
general O

His O
son O

the O
father O
of O
the O

had O
in O
his O
early O

the O

so O

the O

Etiquette O
at O
that O

was O
not O
what O
it O
became O
much O
later O
— O
an O
element O
of O
such O
importance O
in O
the O
education O
of O
every O
samurai O
as O
to O
curb O
temporarily O
the O
fiercest O
temper O
and O
force O
the O
most O
headstrong O
passions O
to O
subordinate O
themselves O
to O
time O
and O
place O

The O
long O
reign O
of O
peace O
had O
its O
softening O
influence O
; O
yet O
, O
although O
threatening O
talk O
and O
angry O
looks O
were O
not O
as O
likely O
as O
before O
to O
lead O
to O
immediate O
violence O
, O
they O
were O
strangers O
neither O
at O
the O
festive O
board O
nor O
in O
the O
council O

hall O
. O

An O
utter O
disregard O
, O
however O
, O
for O
all O
rules O
of O
society O
as O
they O
existed O
even O
then O
, O
and O
a O
reckless O
fashion O
of O
indulging O
his O
passions O
when O
aroused O

made O
Ono B-PERSON

Sawa I-PERSON
a O
man O
to O
be O
carefully O
humored O
by O
his O

. O

An O
incident O
which O
had O
happened O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
previously O
was O
still O
fresh O
in O
the O
memory O
of O
every O
one O
. O

An O
embassy O
had O
arrived O
from O
the O
province O
of O
Sendai B-GPE
to O
arrange O
a O
marriage O
between O
the O
son O
of O
the O
lord O
of O
that O
province O
and O
a O
daughter O
of O
Ono B-PERSON

Sawa I-PERSON
. O

All O
the O
preliminaries O
had O
been O
concluded O
, O
and O
a O
grand O
festival O
and O
banquet O
were O
being O
given O
in O
honor O
of O
the O
occasion O
. O

Toward O
the O
end O
of O
the O
carouse O
, O
when O
wine O
had O
loosened O
tongues O
and O
conversation O
had O
become O
general O
, O
the O
chief O
ambassador O
, O
perhaps O
in O
ignorance O
or O
inadvertence O
, O
but O
more O
probably O
from O
a O
desire O
to O
check O
the O
feeling O
of O
pride O
with O
which O
he O
had O
so O
often O
been O
received O
, O
essayed O
a O
joke O
about O
the O
silk O
which O
faced O
the O
dress O
of O
his O
host O
. O

“ O
You O
must O
be O
a O
good O
judge O
of O
dyeing O
, O
and O
perhaps O
have O
a O
special O
receipt O
handed O
down O
to O
you O
, O
to O
give O
that O
ribbon O
such O
a O
rich O
, O
deep O
purple O
color O
, O
” O
he O
began O
; O
but O
if O
he O
had O
intended O
to O
say O
more O
, O
the O
general O
silence O
which O
followed O
this O
remark O
caused O
him O
to O
refrain O
. O

The O
sudden O
cessation O
of O
all O
mirth O
and O
conversation O
struck O
those O
present O
as O
with O
a O
chill O
, O
and O
the O
laughing O
faces O
of O
a O
moment O
before O
now O
showed O
only O
anxious O
looks O
furtively O
directed O
toward O
their O
lord O
. O

Ono B-PERSON
ga I-PERSON
Sawa I-PERSON
’s O
face O
, O
though O
flushed O
with O
wine O
, O
became O
overspread O
with O
a O
deadly O
pallor O
. O

The O
silence O
of O
his O
followers O
not O
only O
prevented O
him O
from O
overlooking O
a O
remark O
which O
in O
cooler O
moments O
he O
might O
perhaps O
have O
disregarded O
, O
but O
gave O
it O
undue O
prominence O
. O

Before O
the O
assembled O
guests O
had O
twice O
drawn O
breath O
he O
had O
unsheathed O
his O
small O
sword O
and O
aimed O
a O
desperate O
blow O
at O
the O
ambassador O
. O

The O
excess O
of O
his O
fury O
, O
rather O
than O
a O
natural O
shrinking O
away O
on O
the O
part O
of O
his O
intended O
victim O
, O
caused O
the O
weapon O
to O
miscarry O
, O
only O
slightly O
grazing O
the O
other O
’s O
skin O
and O
drawing O
a O
few O
drops O
of O
blood O
; O
but O
this O
was O
sufficient O
to O
enable O
him O
to O
regain O
his O
self O
- O
control O
. O

Those O
composing O
the O
ambassador O
’s O
suite O
had O
risen O
with O
muttered O
threats O
and O
placed O
themselves O
behind O
their O
chief O
; O
while O
the O
Kuwana B-NORP
men O
, O
who O
formed O
the O
large O
majority O
, O
also O
rose O
and O
surrounded O
their O
lord O
. O

The O
latter O
, O
however O
, O
now O
perfectly O
calm O
, O
with O
one B-CARDINAL
glance O
caused O
his O
retainers O
to O
resume O
their O
stations O
. O

Slowly O
replacing O
his O
sword O
, O
to O
show O
he O
meant O
no O
further O
violence O
, O
but O
only B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
sheathing O
it O
, O
and O
keeping O
it O
firmly O
grasped O
, O
he O
said O
: O
“ O
The O
only O
kind O
of O
dyeing O
I O
understand O
is O
dyeing O
with O
blood O
; O
those O
spots O
upon O
your O
doublet O
now O
show O
the O
same O
color O
as O
my O
ribbon O
— O
the O
color O
of O
blood O
, O
the O
color O
I O
love O
to O
see O
whenever O
honor O
demands O
it O
. O
” O

In O
saying O
this O
, O
his O
meaning O
was O
not O
to O
be O
misunderstood O
. O

He O
showed O
himself O
ready O
to O
stand O
by O
the O
consequences O
of O
his O
act O
; O
yet O
there O
was O
a O
certain O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
conciliatory O
tone O
and O
manner O
about O
him O
of O
which O
the O
other O
thought O
best O
to O
avail O
himself O
. O

He O
knew O
that O
if O
the O
failure O
of O
the O
important O
mission O
with O
which O
he O
was O
intrusted O
could O
be O
attributed O
to O
his O
own O
lack O
of O
discretion O
— O
to O
which O
in O
this O
instance O
it O
might O
be O
ascribed O
, O
although O
the O
provocation O
he O
had O
given O
was O
certainly O
a O
slight O
one O
— O
it O
would O
end O
in O
his O
own O
disgrace O
with O
his O
lord O
. O

So O
, O
quickly O
collecting O
himself O
, O
with O
a O
laugh O
as O
natural O
as O
he O
could O
simulate O
, O
he O
replied O
: O
“ O
You O
have O
certainly O
given O
us O
a O
good O
practical O
illustration O
of O
what O
you O
call O
your O
style O
of O
dyeing O
, O
and O
if O
you O
intended O
it O
as O
a O
lesson O
, O
I O
will O
accept O
it O
as O
such O
from O
you O
; O
although O
there O
are O
very O
few O
lords O
in O
this O
kingdom O
for O
whom O
it O
would O
be O
safe O
or O
advisable O
to O
attempt O
a O
similar O
course O
of O
teaching O
with O
me O
. O
” O

Physical O
courage O
in O
those B-DATE
days I-DATE
was O
a O
common O
virtue O
, O
and O
that O
of O
the O
envoy O
was O
too O
well O
known O
to O
be O
doubted O
; O
his O
course O
in O
ignoring O
the O
rash O
act O
prompted O
by O
the O
other O
’s O
ungovernable O
temper O
only O
raised O
him O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
every O
one O
present O
, O
including O
Ono B-PERSON
ga I-PERSON
Sawa I-PERSON
himself O
. O

It O
was O
probably O
the O
only O
period O
in O
the O
history O
of O
Japan B-GPE
when O
such O
an O
occurrence O
could O
have O
taken O
place O
without O
entailing O
more O
serious O
consequences O
. O

During O
the O
long O
civil O
wars O
which O
were O
soon O
to O
follow O
, O
peaceful O
solutions O
of O
any O
difficulty O
were O
again O
out O
of O
the O
question O
; O
and O
after O
that O
time O
the O
observance O
of O
etiquette O
was O
made O
so O
imperative O
that O
such O
a O
breach O
of O
it O
as O
had O
been O
here O
committed O
by O
Ono B-PERSON
ga I-PERSON
Sawa I-PERSON
would O
have O
demanded O
redress O
by O
law O
, O
and O
would O
have O
subjected O
its O
perpetrator O
to O
severe O
punishment O
by O
the O
court O
of O
the O
Shôgun O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
up O
to O
a O
hundred O
years O
previous O
, O
when O
fighting O
was O
the O
rule O
all O
over O
the O
land O
to O
the O
exclusion O
of O
everything O
else O
, O
such O
a O
course O
as O
had O
been O
here O
taken O
by O
the O
ambassador O
would O
certainly O
not O
have O
been O
appreciated O
; O
it O
would O
have O
been O
utterly O
opposed O
to O
the O
spirit O
of O
an O
age O
which O
acknowledged O
no O
other O
honorable O
means O
of O
redress O
than O
an O
appeal O
to O
arms O
, O
and O
which O
did O
not O
permit O
any O
qualification O
as O
to O
time O
and O
place O
, O
but O
demanded O
instant O
and O
unhesitating O
action O
, O
even O
if O
self O
- O
destruction O
was O
the O
certain O
result O
. O

But O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
hundred I-DATE
years I-DATE
had O
wrought O
a O
considerable O
change O
. O

Nominally O
the O
profession O
of O
arms O
was O
still O
the O
only O
one O
a O
gentleman O
could O
engage O
in O
; O
but O
literature O
, O
art O
, O
and O
the O
polite O
accomplishments O
had O
begun O
to O
claim O
a O
fair O
share O
of O
attention O
. O

The O
strong O
government O
of O
the O
Hōjō B-PERSON
at O
Kamakura B-GPE
had O
improved O
laws O
and O
regulations O
and O
caused O
them O
to O
be O
respected O
, O
thus O
imbuing O
the O
rising O
generation O
with O
a O
sense O
of O
order O
and O
obedience O
to O
which O
their O
forefathers O
had O
been O
strangers O
. O

It O
was O
a O
salutary O
discipline O
, O
which O
naturally O
found O
its O
counterpart O
in O
a O
certain O
self O
- O
restraint O
introduced O
into O
the O
social O
relations O
of O
life O
, O
into O
the O
intercourse O
between O
man O
and O
man O
. O

Every O
samurai O
was O
still O
ready O
and O
eager O
to O
serve O
actively O
as O
a O
soldier O
; O
but O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
such O
opportunities O
he O
tried O
to O
show O
his O
aptitude O
for O
other O
pursuits O
. O

Many O
descendants O
of O
the O
royal O
house O
of O
Fujiwara B-GPE
more O
especially O
distinguished O
themselves O
in O
civil O
employment O
. O

The O
centre O
of O
the O
whole O
movement O
— O
from O
whence O
, O
indeed O
, O
it O
derived O
its O
principal O
support O
— O
was O
the O
Mikado B-ORG
’s O
court O
at O
Kiyoto B-GPE
. O

Soon O
after O
the O

CHAPTER B-LAW
II I-LAW
. O

The O
evening O
before O
the O
appointed O
day O
all O
the O
inns O
were O
filled O
to O
overflowing O
, O
and O
fresh O
visitors O
arrived O
far O
on O
into O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
only O
to O
be O
followed O
, O
with O
the O
dawn O
, O
by O
still O
greater O
crowds O
. O

Most O
of O
them O
were O
farmers O
from O
the O
surrounding O
country O
; O
but O
a O
goodly O
share O
of O
strangers O
was O
not O
wanting O
, O
and O
all O
found O
plenty O
to O
interest O
them O
. O

Theatres O
at O
that O
time O
were O
not O
known O
; O
but O
tight O
- O
rope O
performers O
, O
jugglers O
, O
dancers O
, O
story O
- O
tellers O
, O
and O
ballad O
- O
singers O
were O
in O
abundance O
, O
all O
doing O
a O
thriving O
trade O
. O

Among O
the O
spectators O
was O
a O
party O
of O
three B-CARDINAL
, O
who O
had O
come O
late O
in O
the O
day O
and O
who O
stood O
on O
a O
little O
knoll O
close O
to O
one O
of O
the O
entrances O
, O
looking O
at O
the O
feats O
of O
riding O
and O
of O
kisha B-GPE
( O
archery O
on O
horseback O
) O
, O
dakiu B-PERSON
( O
polo O
) O
, O
inu O
- O
o O
- O
mono O
( O
dog O
- O
hunting O
) O
, O
and O
other O
sports O
. O

The O
group O
consisted O
of O
a O
tall O
, O
sinewy O
man O
of O
about B-CARDINAL
thirty I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
five I-CARDINAL
years I-CARDINAL
, O
although O
his O
sad O
, O
furrowed O
face O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
sight O
made O
him O
look O
much O
older O
, O
a O
boy O
not O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
ten I-CARDINAL
by O
his O
side O
, O
and O
behind O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
one O
who O
was O
evidently O
an O
old O
retainer O
. O

The O
boy O
was O
the O
son O
of O
his O
companion O
, O
as O
could O
be O
seen O
at O
a O
glance O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
fresh O
, O
bright O
, O
sunny O
countenance O
of O
the O
one O
, O
and O
the O
careworn O
, O
anxious O
look O
of O
the O
other O
. O

The O
contour O
of O
the O
lad O
’s O
face O
was O
the O
same O
as O
that O
of O
the O
man O
; O
the O
mouth O
, O
although O
smiling O
with O
the O
innocence O
of O
childhood O
, O
had O
the O
same O
resolute O
cast O
, O
and O
the O
eyes O
, O
now O
flashing O
with O
delight O
at O
the O
gay O
scene O
before O
them O
, O
shone O
with O
that O
look O
of O
cool O
, O
determined O
daring O
so O
conspicuous O
in O
the O
father O
. O

In O
the O
man O
’s O
case O
, O
indeed O
, O
this O
last O
feature O
was O
developed O
to O
an O
extent O
rarely O
seen O
; O
yet O
it O
nevertheless O
seemed O
so O
utterly O
at O
variance O
with O
the O
settled O
, O
gloomy O
dejection O
which O
overspread O
his O
face O
that O
even O
a O
passer O
- O
by O
would O
have O
been O
disposed O
to O
step O
and O
wonder O
whether O
such O
a O
character O
could O
bear O
to O
submit O
to O
even O
the O
most O
pitiless O
blows O
of O
fortune O
, O
rather O
than O
battle O
with O
them O
and O
win O
victory O
or O
find O
rest O
in O
death O
. O

In O
this O
melancholy O
aspect O
, O
the O
man O
offered O
a O
marked O
contrast O
to O
the O
great O
throng O
of O
sight O
- O
seers O
, O
whose O
faces O
reflected O
only O
mirth O
and O
enjoyment O
; O
and O
they O
looked O
at O
him O
from O
time O
to O
time O
with O
no O
little O
awe O
, O
giving O
to O
him O
and O
his O
companions O
a O
wide O
berth O
, O
although O
the O
grounds O
elsewhere O
were O
crowded O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
dresses O
of O
the O
party O
, O
which O
showed O
them O
to O
be O
samurai O
, O
contributed O
to O
this O
feeling O
of O
respect O
; O
for O
members O
of O
the O
military O
class O
did O
not O
generally O
, O
on O
such O
occasions O
, O
mix O
with O
the O
common O
people O
, O
but O
remained O
on O
the O
platforms O
and O
stands O
erected O
for O
them O
. O

Although O
, O
however O
, O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
travellers O
wore O
samurai O
dresses O
, O
these O
were O
of O
the O
poorest O
description O
, O
stained O
by O
travel O
and O
weather O
, O
and O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
swords O
which O
each O
carried O
in O
his O
girdle O
showed O
no O
ornament O
whatever O
. O

The O
games O
had O
been O
progressing O
for O
some O
time O
, O
and O
the O
horses O
— O
often O
mercilessly O
punished O
— O
became O
excited O
and O
restive O
; O
when O
at O
last O
one O
, O
whose O
youthful O
rider O
had O
treated O
him O
to O
too O
many O
kicks O
of O
his O
heavy O
stirrups O
, O
became O
uncontrollable O
, O
and O
dashing O
madly O
by O
the O
grand O
stand O
where O
Lord O
Ono B-PERSON
ga I-PERSON
Sawa I-PERSON
was O
sitting O
, O
galloped O
headlong O
toward O
the O
entrance O
. O

Two B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
nimble O
- O
footed O
bettoes O
( O
horse O
- O
boys O
) O
who O
tried O
to O
stop O
the O
runaway O
were O
thrown O
off O
without O
difficulty O
, O
and O
a O
few O
steps O
more O
would O
have O
brought O
the O
horse O
in O
contact O
with O
the O
frightened O
crowd O
of O
human O
beings O
congregated O
beyond O
the O
barriers O
, O
when O
the O
older O
stranger O
, O
already O
mentioned O
, O
stepped O
forward O
, O
and O
catching O
hold O
of O
the O
bridle O
, O
arrested O
the O
animal O
without O
apparently O
any O
very O
great O
exertion O
. O

The O
rider O
, O
who O
had O
managed O
to O
keep O
his O
seat O
upon O
his O
runaway O
steed O
, O
expressed O
his O
warmest O
thanks O
; O
and O
shortly O
afterward O
a O
special O
messenger O
came O
with O
Ono B-PERSON
ga I-PERSON
Sawa I-PERSON
’s O
orders O
to O
offer O
places O
to O
the O
stranger O
and O
his O
party O
, O
and O
to O
invite O
them O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
games O
, O
if O
they O
desired O
to O
do O
so O
. O

A O
ready O
assent O
was O
given O
to O
this O
invitation O
, O
and O
after O
seeing O
his O
companions O
seated O
, O
the O
stranger O
mounted O
a O
horse O
provided O
for O
him O
and O
entered O
the O
lists O
. O

From O
the O
very O
outset O
he O
showed O
himself O
to O
be O
more O
than O
a O
match O
for O
any O
one O
present O
, O
excelling O
in O
riding O
, O
fencing O
, O
archery O
, O
and O
in O
every O
other O
manly O
accomplishment O
there O
displayed O
. O

Yet O
his O
face O
never O
relaxed O
its O
severe O
, O
taciturn O
expression O
; O
and O
although O
he O
was O
scrupulously O
polite O
and O
attentive O
to O
every O
detail O
of O
knightly O
courtesy O
, O
he O
went O
through O
it O
all O
, O
not O
like O
an O
enthusiastic O
votary O
, O
but O
rather O
as O
a O
man O
fulfilling O
a O
duty O
which O
involved O
no O
thought O
of O
pleasurable O
excitement O
. O

A O
very O
flattering O
invitation O
to O
visit O
the O
castle O
and O
partake O
of O
the O
feast O
spread O
there O
, O
and O
also O
to O
present O
himself O
formally O
before O
the O
Duke O
, O
was O
at O
once O
extended O
to O
him O
. O

When O
in O
the O
evening O
he O
repaired O
thither O
with O
his O
companions O
, O
it O
was O
easy O
to O
see O
that O
the O
report O
of O
his O
exploits O
had O
preceded O
his O
arrival O
. O

Every O
eye O
was O
upon O
him O
as O
he O
passed O
to O
the O
inner O
hall O
, O
where O
Ono B-PERSON
ga I-PERSON
Sawa I-PERSON
, O
surrounded O
by O
his O
principal O
vassals O
, O
received O
him O
with O
more O
state O
and O
ceremony O
than O
an O
unknown O
and O
unheralded O
stranger O
could O
well O
have O
expected O
. O

“ O
I O
have O
been O
a O
pleased O
witness O
of O
your O
feats O
of O
strength O
and O
skill O
to O
- O
day O
, O
” O
the O
Duke B-ORG
began O
, O
after O
the O
new O
- O
comer O
had O
made O
the O
usual O
obeisance O
, O
“ O
and O
I O
wish O
to O
ask O
you O
whether O
, O
if O
not O
bound O
by O
other O
ties O
, O
you O
are O
willing O
to O
engage O
yourself O
at O
my O
court O
. O
” O

“ O
I O
am O
now O
seeking O
where O
to O
tender O
my O
services O
, O
and O
I O
shall O
be O
thankful O
to O
be O
able O
to O
do O
so O
here O
, O
” O
was O
the O
rather O
short O
, O
but O
respectfully O
given O
, O
answer O
. O

When O
the O
Duke B-ORG
spoke O
again O
, O
his O
tone O
was O
a O
shade O
less O
courteous O
and O
pleasant O
. O

The O
stranger O
had O
taken O
his O
grace O
too O
much O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
course O
. O

He O
expected O
a O
little O
more O
empressement O
. O

He O
was O
accustomed O
to O
see O
his O
favors O
received O
more O
demonstratively O
; O
and O
being O
of O
a O
jovial O
disposition O
himself O
, O
this O
cold O
, O
unbending O
reserve O
in O
place O
of O
the O
warm O
acknowledgments O
which O
he O
expected O
somewhat O
displeased O
him O
. O

“ O
You O
know O
who O
I O
am O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
and O
as O
he O
continued O
, O
the O
shade O
of O
hauteur O
which O
he O
had O
assumed O
deepened O
; O
“ O
I O
am O
Ono B-PERSON
ga I-PERSON
Sawa I-PERSON
, O
the O
lord O
of O
this O
province O
, O
the O
descendant O
of O
Kamatari B-PERSON
; O
and O
I O
require O
that O
those O
who O
surround O
me O
shall O
be O
men O
of O
tried O
valor O
and O
attainments O
, O
as O
well O
as O
of O
distinguished O
family O
and O
honorable O
name O
. O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
of O
these O
qualifications O
you O
have O
shown O
that O
you O
possess O
in O
an O
eminent O
degree O
, O
and O
it O
only O
remains O
for O
me O
to O
ask O
who O
you O
are O
and O
where O
you O
come O
from O
. O
” O

The O
stranger O
bowed O
his O
head O
low O
; O
but O
his O
humility O
did O
not O
affect O
his O
tone O
of O
speech O
, O
which O
was O
firm O
and O
decided O
. O

“ O
If O
your O
highness O
deigns O
to O
accept O
my O
services O
, O
although O
there O
may O
be O
many O
superior O
to O
me O
in O
abilities O
, O
none O
will O
excel O

in O
strict O
performance O

my O

not O
that O
I O
had O
known O
that O
your O
highness O
was O
a O
lord O
of O
great O
merit O
and O
high O
repute O
, O
I O
never O
would O
have O
asked O
for O
or O
even O
accepted O
your O
offer O
of O
engagement O
. O

I O
am O
now O
a O
ronin O
, O
and O
am O
called O
Mutto B-PERSON
Nobuyuki I-PERSON
; O
but O
my O
real O
name O
and O
where O
I O
come O
from O
I O
can O
not O
disclose O
. O
” O

There O
was O
a O
pause O
which O
appeared O
very O
long O
to O
the O
assembled O
courtiers O
, O
during O
which O
the O
Duke B-ORG
scrutinized O
the O
stranger O
with O
a O
searching O
glance O
. O

What O
he O
saw O
there O
probably O
satisfied O
him O
that O
the O
other O
had O
spoken O
truly O
. O

In O
a O
tone O
which O
, O
although O
stern O
, O
showed O
nothing O
of O
displeasure O
, O
he O
at O
last O
said O
— O
“ O
You O
have O
given O
me O
abundant O
proof O
of O
your O
prowess O
of O
body O
and O
skill O
of O
arm O
; O
and O
if O
the O
strength O
and O
depth O
of O
your O
devotion O
prove O
equal O
to O
these O
, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
your O
boldness O
of O
speech O
, O
I O
can O
well O
congratulate O
myself O
upon O
enlisting O
you O
in O
my O
service O
. O
” O

“ O
I O
have O
spoken O
as O
becomes O
a O
free O
, O
unfettered O
samurai O
, O
” O
replied O
the O
stranger O
. O

“ O
Once O
admitted O
among O
your O
liegemen O
, O
my O
speech O
will O
seldom O
be O
heard O
except O
in O
due O
deferential O
response O
to O
your O
orders O
. O
” O

“ O
Be O
it O
so O
, O
then O
. O

You O
shall O
have O
your O
house O
within O
the O
castle O
, O
and O
I O
will O
herewith O
make O
you O
an O
allowance O
of O
fifty B-MONEY
koku I-MONEY
of O
rice O
for O
your O
maintenance O
. O
” O

This O
was O
certainly O
a O
liberal O
allowance O
for O
those O
times O
, O
and O
Mutto B-PERSON
acknowledged O
it O
in O
fitting O
terms O
. O

He O
then O
asked O
permission O
to O
introduce O
his O
son O
, O
and O
the O
boy O
’s O
bright O
, O
intelligent O
face O
and O
frank O
yet O
respectful O
behavior O
found O
great O
favor O
. O

The O
Duke B-ORG
spoke O
to O
him O
in O
a O
kind O
, O
almost O
fatherly O
, O
way O
, O
and O
on O
dismissing O
him O
ordered O
his O
treasurer O
to O
give O
him O
a O
few O
gold O
ornaments O
to O
put O
on O
his O
sword O
. O

He O
also O
directed O
that O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
banquet O
should O
be O
assigned O
to O
him O
by O
the O
side O
of O
his O
father O
. O

This O
brought O
the O
audience O
to O
a O
close O
. O

Etiquette O
required O
them O
to O
remain O
at O
the O
feast O
until O
after O
the O
Duke B-ORG
had O
left O
the O
hall O
, O
and O
it O
was O
far O
into O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
before O
they O
retired O
to O
the O
house O
which O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
had O
been O
prepared O
for O
their O
reception O
. O

Their O
servant O
, O
Yamagawa B-PERSON
, O
had O
arranged O
everything O
in O
their O
new O
domicile O
; O
and O
although O
their O
own O
luggage O
was O
meagre O
enough O
, O
nothing O
necessary O
for O
comfort O
was O
lacking O
, O
the O
Duke B-ORG
having O
given O
special O
orders O
that O
everything O
that O
was O
wanted O
should O
be O
supplied O
from O
the O
ducal O
storehouses O
. O

CHAPTER O
III O
. O

In O
this O
place O
for O
some B-DATE
years I-DATE
to O
come O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
strangers O
continued O
to O
live O
a O
quiet O
, O
uneventful O
life O
. O

Mutto B-PERSON
scrupulously O
attended O
to O
his O
court O
duties O
as O
one O
of O
the O
chamberlains O
at O
the O
palace O
; O
but O
every O
moment O
of O
the O
time O
which O
he O
could O
call O
his O
own O
was O
devoted O
to O
the O
education O
of O
his O
son O
. O

Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
as O
the O
boy O
was O
called O
, O
was O
already O
at O
the B-DATE
age I-DATE
of I-DATE
fifteen I-DATE
a O
man O
inferior O
to O
none O
, O
and O
almost O
the O
equal O
of O
his O
father O
in O
all O
manly O
accomplishments O
. O

Nor O
had O
his O
mind O
been O
forgotten O
. O

Mutto B-PERSON
himself O
was O
a O
fair O
scholar O
, O
and O
where O
he O
thought O
himself O
deficient O
, O
or O
was O
unable O
through O
lack O
of O
time O
to O
devote O
the O
necessary O
attention O
, O
he O
had O
taken O
care O
to O
secure O
the O
best O
teachers O
. O

The O
latter O
gladly O
undertook O
the O
charge O
of O
instructing O
the O
boy O
, O
whose O
aptitude O
for O
acquiring O
knowledge O
was O
as O
marked O
as O
his O
ways O
and O
manners O
were O
winning O
. O

His O
father O
strictly O
supervised O
and O
regulated O
his O
studies O
, O
and O
showed O
himself O
somewhat O
a O
hard O
taskmaster O
, O
who O
never O
allowed O
Sennoske B-PERSON
leisure O
for O
any O
amusements O
except O
such O
as O
would O
either O
strengthen O
his O
body O
or O
improve O
his O
mind O
, O
and O
the O
boy O
grew O
up O
having O
no O
desire O
for O
other O
recreation O
. O

Although O
passionately O
fond O
of O
books O
and O
of O
indoor O
studies O
, O
the O
tendency O
of O
the O
times O
and O
the O
examples O
set O
before O
him O
by O
his O
father O
, O
as O
well O
as O
by O
others O
, O
roused O
his O
ambition O
and O
prevented O
anything O
like O
neglect O
of O
physical O
training O
. O

This O
severe O
bodily O
and O
mental O
work O
had O
become O
easy O
to O
him O
, O
and O
to O
pass O
from O
one O
to O
the O
other O
was O
all O
that O
his O
system O
needed O
, O
and O
all O
the O
enjoyment O
he O
cared O
for O
. O

His O
intense O
love O
and O
admiration O
for O
his O
father O
, O
and O
the O
pleasure O
which O
he O
derived O
from O
the O
gratification O
the O
latter O
showed O
at O
his O
quick O
and O
steady O
progress O
, O
was O
another O
reason O
, O
if O
one O
had O
been O
needed O
, O
to O
impel O
him O
to O
diligence O
. O

To O
Sennoske B-PERSON
his O
father O
was O
everything O
that O
was O
good O
and O
great O
and O
noble O
. O

He O
knew O
and O
felt O
how O
much O
kindness O
and O
sympathy O
were O
hidden O
under O
that O
austere O
taciturnity O
which O
in O
all B-DATE
these I-DATE
years I-DATE
had O
never O
relaxed O
into O
the O
faintest O
semblance O
of O
a O
smile O
. O

He O
remembered O
a O
sunny O
childhood O
in O
a O
beautiful O
home O
, O
where O
his O
father O
had O
laughed O
and O
played O
with O
him O
, O
always O
showing O
a O
gay O
, O
cheerful O
face O
; O
and O
he O
felt O
what O
a O
terrible O
shock O
must O
have O
been O
given O
to O
that O
nature O
by O
some O
fearful O
calamity O
, O
thus O
to O
freeze O
up O
all O
apparent O
sympathy O
and O
feeling O
for O
the O
outside O
world O
. O

He O
had O
no O
knowledge O
of O
what O
could O
have O
been O
the O
catastrophe O
that O
wrought O
this O
change O
; O
and O
any O
allusion O
to O
their O
former O
life O
, O
although O
not O
forbidden O
in O
so O
many O
words O
, O
was O
yet O
discouraged O
by O
his O
father O
in O
a O
way O
that O
prevented O
his O
ever O
referring O
to O
it O
. O

Among O
those O
who O
contributed O
to O
Sennoske B-PERSON
’s O
training O
was O
one O
whose O
name O
was O
then O
already O
famous O
in O
Japan B-GPE
— O
Muramasa B-PERSON
, O
the O
sword O
- O
smith O
. O

An O
immense O
gulf O
divided O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
the O
samurai O
from O
the O
merchant O
, O
the O
farmer O
, O
the O
artisan O
, O
and O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
from O
all O
other O
classes O
. O

To O
this O
rule O
the O
sword O
- O
smith O
formed O
the O
only O
exception O
. O

He O
Who O
could O
forge O
a O
sword O
fairly O
well O
stood O
far O
higher O
in O
social O
rank O
than O
the O
artisan O
of O
equal O
skill O
in O
any O
other O
profession O
; O
and O
a O
master O
of O
the O
art O
, O
however O
low O
his O
extraction O
, O
was O
considered O
and O
treated O
as O
an O
equal O
by O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
- O
sworded O
gentry O
. O

Muramasa B-PERSON
then O
stood O
at O
the O
head O
of O
his O
profession O
, O
without O
a O
rival O
in O
the O
country O
. O

His O
superiority O
was O
acknowledged O
by O
his O
brother O
artisans O
as O
well O
as O
by O
the O
nobility O
; O
and O
many O
of O
the O
latter O
— O
men O
of O
great O
means O
too O
— O
would O
willingly O
have O
beggared O
themselves O
to O
obtain O
a O
sword O
of O
his O
making O
. O

To O
have O
a O
man O
like O
this O
living O
in O
his O
dominions O
was O
considered O
a O
great O
honor O
, O
and O
was O
, O
moreover O
, O
a O
source O
of O
real O
power O
and O
influence O
, O
of O
which O
the O
Duke B-ORG
was O
fully O
aware O
; O
and O
he O
had O
made O
to O
the O
smith O
the O
most O
extravagant O
offers O
of O
money O
, O
titles O
, O
and O
other O
honorary O
considerations O
to O
induce O
him O
duly O
to O
inscribe O
himself O
on O
the O
roll O
of O
his O
feudal O
retainers O
, O
but O
without O
success O
. O

Threats O
or O
coercion O
would O
have O
been O
worse O
than O
useless O
with O
a O
man O
whom O
the O
Shôgun O
himself O
would O
only O
too O
gladly O
have O
welcomed O
to O
his O
capital O
( O
Kamakura B-GPE
) O
, O
and O
would O
have O
honored O
there O
as O
highly O
as O
the O
Duke B-ORG
did O
in O
his O
province O
. O

Any O
wilful O
injury O
done O
him O
would O
have O
been O
resented O
as O
a O
national O
loss O
by O
every O
samurai O
in O
the O
country O
; O
so O
Ono B-PERSON
ga I-PERSON
Sawa I-PERSON
had O
fain O
to O
be O
satisfied O
with O
the B-ORG
sword I-ORG
- I-ORG
smith I-ORG
’s I-ORG
independent O
way O
of O
living O
, O
taking O
care O
, O
however O
, O
to O
use O
every O
opportunity O
to O
prove O
to O
him O
, O
by O
valuable O
gifts O
and O
otherwise O
, O
the O
honor O
and O
esteem O
in O
which O
he O
was O
held O
. O

And O
there O
was O
good O
reason O
for O
all O
this O
regard O
and O
high O
consideration O
; O
for O
those O
famous O
“ O
Muramasas B-GPE
, O
” O
as O
the O
blades O
were O
called O
after O
their O
maker O
, O
were O
things O
of O
beauty O
, O
of O
joy O
, O
of O
pride O
, O
and O
of O
power O
to O
their O
lucky O
possessors O
. O

The O
smith B-PERSON
himself O
was O
an O
expert O
at O
using O
as O
well O
as O
making O
his O
weapon O
, O
and O
the O
proofs O
he O
had O
sometimes O
semi O
- O
publicly O
given O
of O
its O
excellence O
were O
marvellous O
, O
and O
wellnigh O
bordered O
on O
the O
incredible O
. O

He O
would O
cut O
a O
hair O
let O
fall O
in O
the O
air O
; O
he O
would O
hold O
his O
sword O
still O
in O
the O
water O
, O
with O
its O
sharp O
edge O
facing O
the O
current O
, O
and O
there O
it O
would O
of O
itself O
out O
a O
piece O
of O
paper O
floating O
toward O
it O
; O
then O
again O
, O
to O
show O
its O
strength O
, O
he O
would O
cut O
through O
a O
copper O
bar O
an O
inch O
in O
thickness O
without O
producing O
the O
slightest O
mark O
or O
indentation O
on O
the O
blade O
. O

Once O
, O
on O
a O
memorable O
occasion O
when O
discussion O
as O
to O
the O
relative O
merits O
of O
rival O
sword O
- O
smiths O
ran O
high O
, O
he O
asked O
that O
any O
three B-CARDINAL
swords O
of O
the O
best O
makers O
be O
selected O
. O

This O
was O
done O
; O
and O
placing O
them O
side O
by O
side O
, O
he O
dealt O
with O
his O
own O
blade O
terrific O
blow O
square O
upon O
their O
upturned O
edges O
. O

It O
went O
entirely O
through O
one B-CARDINAL
sword O
, O
which O
was O
the O
most O
strongly O
curved O
, O
passed O
through O
the O
steel O
edges O
of O
the O
others O
, O
and O
remained O
imbedded O
in O
the O
softer O
part O
which O
forms O
the O
back O
. O

Being O
with O
difficulty O
extracted O
, O
it O
was O
found O
that O
its O
own O
sharp O
edge O
had O
remained O
intact O
; O
and O
there O
was O
nothing O
but O
a O
slightly O
increased O
brightness O
in O
three B-CARDINAL
different O
spots O
to O
show O
where O
it O
had O
been O
in O
contact O
. O

Small O
wonder O
, O
then O
, O
that O
a O
true O
samurai O
should O
value O
such O
a O
weapon O
above O
every O
other O
earthly O
possession O
. O

Money O
alone O
could O
not O
buy O
one O
. O

It O
began O
to O
be O
known O
that O
only O
warriors O
of O
high O
standing O
, O
whose O
reputation O
for O
valor O
and O
fighting O
qualities O
was O
established O
, O
could O
succeed O
in O
having O
an O
order O
for O
a O
sword O
executed O
. O

If O
the O
applicant O
had O
a O
name O
for O
loving O
fighting O
for O
its O
own O
sake O
— O
one O
who O
, O
when O
no O
opportunities O
for O
legitimate O
warfare O
presented O
themselves O
, O
would O
hunt O
up O
broils O
, O
quarrels O
, O
and O
duels O
— O
it O
greatly O
enhanced O
his O
chances O
of O
a O
favorable O
reception O
from O
the O
sword O
- O
smith O
. O

The O
prices O
paid O
were O
always O
high O
enough O
; O
but O
far O
more O
liberal O
offers O
had O
often O
been O
refused O
because O
made O
by O
men O
— O
as O
the O
report O
went O
— O
whose O
reputation O
credited O
them O
with O
inclinations O
, O
if O
not O
of O
a O
pacific O
, O
yet O
of O
a O
less O
decidedly O
bellicose O
nature O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
Muramasa B-PERSON
’s O
stipulations O
in O
former B-DATE
years I-DATE
had O
been O
that O
no O
sword O
bought O
of O
him O
should O
be O
sold O
during O
the O
lifetime O
of O
the O
purchaser O
. O

He O
dispensed O
with O
this O
condition O
now O
, O
because O
there O
was O
no O
further O
need O
for O
it O
; O
the O
lucky O
possessor O
of O
such O
a O
treasure O
would O
have O
sacrificed O
his O
last O
hakama B-NORP
, O
his O
mistress O
, O
his O
wife O
and O
child O
probably O
, O
sooner O
than O
part O
with O
it O
. O

The O
smith B-PERSON
’s O
residence O
was O
in O
the O
outskirts O
of O
the O
city O
, O
in O
what O
had O
formerly O
been O
called O
the O
village O
of O
Senjuin B-GPE
. O

It O
was O
a O
smoke O
- O
blackened O
, O
gloomy O
looking O
building O
of O
two B-CARDINAL
stories O
close O
to O
the O
street O
, O
the O
lower O
part O
— O
the O
doors O
of O
which O
were O
constantly O
closed O
— O
being O
the O
forge O
. O

On O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
house O
and O
in O
the O
rear O
was O
a O
yard O
which O
was O
enclosed O
with O
a O
bamboo O
fence O
, O
the O
stakes O
being O
placed O
side O
by O
side O
and O
three B-CARDINAL
deep O
— O
thus O
effectually O
preventing O
any O
possibility O
of O
getting O
even O
a O
glimpse O
through O
them O
; O
while O
their O
ends O
were O
sharply O
pointed O
, O
threatening O
certain O
impalement O
to O
any O
who O
should O
attempt O
to O
scale O
them O
. O

Here O
Muramasa B-PERSON
lived O
with O
his O
son O
— O
who O
assisted O
him O
at O
his O
craft O
and O
was O
initiated O
into O
its O
secrets O
— O
his O
daughter O
, O
and O
only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
old O
woman O
- O
servant O
. O

He O
was O
not O
a O
pleasant O
man O
to O
look O
at O
, O
this O
cunning O
forger O
, O
whose O
handiwork O
caused O
the O
great O
and O
the O
mighty O
to O
do O
him O
honor O
. O

His O
eyes O
— O
very O
large O
and O
very O
prominent O
, O
ready O
, O
it O
seemed O
, O
to O
start O
from O
their O
sockets O
— O
had O
a O
sinister O
look O
; O
to O
which O
the O
heavy O
, O
bushy O
eyebrows O
, O
heaviest O
and O
bushiest O
in O
the O
space O
between O
the O
eyes O
, O
where O
they O
met O
, O
doubtless O
contributed O
. O

A O
massive O
chin O
, O
under O
a O
small O
, O
rather O
thin O
- O
lipped O
mouth O
, O
showed O
great O
energy O
and O
determination O
, O
while O
the O
short O
stout O
neck O
, O
with O
veins O
like O
cords O
, O
the O
broad O
shoulders O
, O
and O
the O
brawny O
, O
sinewy O
arms O
, O
gave O
evidence O
of O
great O
physical O
strength O
. O

When O
speaking O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
rows O
of O
large O
, O
regular O
, O
and O
beautifully O
white O
teeth O
partly O
redeemed O
the O
unattractiveness O
of O
the O
other O
features O
; O
but O
when O
angered O
or O
excited O
, O
the O
whole O
face O
presented O
an O
aspect O
of O
extreme O
hideousness O
and O
repulsiveness O
. O

At O
such O
times O
the O
mouth O
was O
firmly O
closed O
; O
the O
eyebrows O
moved O
and O
contracted O
until O
each O
individual O
hair O
seemed O
to O
stand O
on O
end O
; O
the O
eyes O
, O
already O
unnaturally O
large O
and O
protruding O
, O
dilated O
and O
rolled O
around O
in O
their O
sockets O
with O
a O
glitter O
like O
that O
of O
a O
snake O
; O
and O
a O
deep O
red O
, O
furrowed O
line O
showed O
itself O
on O
his O
forehead O
from O
the O
crown O
down O
to O
the O
eyebrows O
, O
making O
his O
head O
look O
as O
if O
it O
consisted O
of O
two B-CARDINAL
halves O
badly O
pasted O
together O
. O

A O
parallel O
had O
often O
been O
drawn O
between O
the O
smith O
and O
Mutto B-PERSON
. O

Both O
these O
men O
, O
renowned O
for O
strength O
and O
skill O
, O
living O
for O
themselves O
and O
seemingly O
desirous O
of O
avoiding O
company O
, O
always O
reserved O
and O
even O
gloomy O
, O
and O
never O
sharing O
in O
wine O
- O
parties O
or O
other O
festivities O
, O
offered O
a O
great O
contrast O
to O
the O
usual O
style O
of O
conduct O
of O
the O
cavaliers O
at O
the O
court O
; O
for O
the O
latter O
, O
acting O
with O
the O
spirit O
of O
the O
age O
, O
although O
ready O
at O
any O
time O
for O
hard O
work O
and O
harder O
blows O
, O
believed O
in O
taking O
pleasure O
and O
amusement O
whenever O
and O
wherever O
it O
could O
be O
found O
. O

But O
when O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
men O
once O
stood O
side O
by O
side O
in O
the O
court O
, O
it O
was O
easy O
to O
perceive O
that O
however O
much O
unlike O
to O
others O
, O
there O
was O
very O
little O
real O
resemblance O
between O
them O
. O

Mutto B-PERSON
’s O
athletic O
but O
slight O
and O
supple O
figure O
was O
cast O
in O
quite O
a O
different O
mould O
from O
the O
smith O
’s O
heavy O
, O
awkward O
- O
looking O
frame O
; O
and O
in O
so O
far O
as O
other O
than O
physical O
attributes O
could O
be O
discerned O
, O
the O
difference O
became O
even O
more O
marked O
. O

The O
look O
of O
gloom O
on O
the O
face O
of O
the O
former O
seemed O
like O
a O
dark O
veil O
, O
obscuring O
its O
naturally O
pleasant O
and O
cheerful O
expression O
. O

The O
regular O
features O
could O
never O
have O
settled O
into O
such O
clearly O
- O
cut O
, O
bold O
, O
determined O
lines O
if O
their O
possessor O
had O
always O
been O
given O
to O
inactive O
brooding O
and O
sorrowing O
. O

They O
now O
spoke O
unmistakably O
of O
weary O
resignation O
; O
but O
it O
was O
a O
new O
- O
born O
resignation O
foreign O
to O
the O
man O
’s O
real O
nature O
, O
and O
implanted O
there O
by O
some O
unaccountable O
calamity O
. O

In O
demeanor O
he O
was O
quiet O
and O
dignified O
, O
and O
in O
the O
performance O
of O
his O
often O
monotonous O
duties O
as O
chamberlain O
he O
had O
been O
known O
to O
stand O
sometimes B-TIME
for I-TIME
hours I-TIME
like O
a O
statue O
, O
scarcely O
moving O
either O
limbs O
or O
features O
. O

With O
the O
smith O
, O
body O
and O
face O
were O
cast O
in O
a O
heavy O
, O
coarse O
mould O
, O
and O
both O
gave O
evidence O
of O
the O
savage O
restlessness O
and O
discontent O
of O
the O
mind O
within O
. O

Very O
seldom O
were O
they O
characterized O
by O
anything O
like O
repose O
. O

In O
general O
the O
eyes O
rolled O
about O
in O
their O
sockets O
, O
glancing O
here O
and O
there O
with O
a O
preoccupied O
air O
, O
while O
the O
whole O
lower O
part O
of O
the O
face O
twitched O
convulsively O
; O
and O
this O
movement O
often O
extended O
even O
to O
the O
limbs O
and O
body O
. O

It O
was O
evident O
that O
no O
other O
influence O
but O
the O
thoughts O
within O
him O
induced O
this O
unquiet O
. O

When O
he O
found O
himself O
observed O
, O
he O
could O
by O
a O
strong O
effort O
resume O
outward O
composure O
; O
but O
he O
would O
at O
such O
times O
hurl O
back O
a O
look O
so O
vicious O
that O
few O
cared O
to O
encounter O
it O
twice O
. O

The O
neighborhood O
where O
the O
smith O
’s O
house O
stood O
was O
very O
lonely O
. O

In O
former B-DATE
years I-DATE
it O
had O
been O
a O
small O
fishing O
- O
village O
called O
Senjuin B-GPE
, O
which O
in O
time O
, O
as O
the O
castle O
- O
town O
of O
Kuwana B-GPE
gradually O
extended O
, O
became O
one O
of O
the O
outskirts O
of O
the O
latter O
. O

This O
was O
many O
hundred O
years O
ago O
. O

With O
its O
loss O
of O
independence O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
proximity O
of O
the O
great O
town O
, O
it O
lost O
also O
its O
well O
- O
to O
- O
do O
look O
, O
and O
became O
the O
resort O
of O
the O
very O
worst O
and O
the O
very O
poorest O
elements O
of O
the O
population O
. O

During O
the O
great O
Minamoto B-GPE
wars O
, O
in O
the B-DATE
twelfth I-DATE
and I-DATE
thirteenth I-DATE
centuries I-DATE
, O
it O
suddenly O
developed O
into O
prosperity O
. O

The O
streets O
became O
lined O
with O
stores O
, O
mechanics O
’ O
workshops O
, O
small O
manufactories O
of O
different O
articles O
of O
military O
equipment O
; O
and O
with O
these O
, O
not O
a O
few O
wine O
- O
shops O
, O
houses O
of O
bad O
repute O
, O
and O
gambling O
- O
dens O
. O

There O
was O
then O
continual O
marching O
and O
countermarching O
; O
regular O
and O
irregular O
bodies O
of O
troops O
, O
such O
as O
could O
be O
induced O
to O
take O
the O
field O
by O
threats O
or O
promises O
, O
through O
motives O
of O
partisan O
loyalty O
, O
from O
love O
of O
adventure O
, O
or O
through O
the O
more O
mercenary O
object O
of O
gain O
or O
booty O
to O
be O
reaped O
, O
were O
being O
continually O
formed O
, O
and O
Kuwana B-GPE
had O
become O
a O
noted O
resort O
for O
such O
bands O
to O
equip O
themselves O
, O
most O
of O
the O
new O
traffic O
concentrating O
itself O
in O
that O
part O
where O
Senjuin B-GPE
had O
formerly O
stood O
. O

The O
town O
possessed O
abundant O
natural O
advantages O
. O

Its O
neighborhood O
abounded O
with O
many O
kinds O
of O
good O
woods O
, O
including O
a O
great O
variety O
of O
bamboos O
— O
so O
necessary O
in O
the O
production O
of O
articles O
of O
every B-DATE
- I-DATE
day I-DATE
use O
. O

Inland O
products O
could O
easily O
and O
cheaply O
be O
brought O
down O
on O
the O
river O
which O
ran O
beside O
the O
town O
. O

Its O
situation O
by O
the O
sea O
- O
shore O
, O
and O
the O
never O
- O
failing O
supply O
of O
fish O
which O
was O
thereby O
secured O
, O
was O
also O
of O
great O
value O
at O
a O
time O
when O
fields O
were O
irregularly O
tilled O
and O
the O
cost O
of O
cereals O
often O
reached O
famine O
prices O
. O

The O
advantage O
of O
being O
able O
to O
go O
and O
come O
by O
sea O
or O
land O
was O
not O
slight O
, O
and O
was O
especially O
appreciated O
by O
those O
lawless O
characters O
who O
abounded O
at O
the O
time O
, O
and O
a O
goodly O
number O
of O
whom O
could O
always O
be O
found O
there O
. O

Whatever O
the O
disposition O
and O
tendency O
of O
these O
gentry O
might O
have O
been O
, O
however O
, O
they O
were O
kept O
in O
check O
by O
the O
proximity O
of O
the O
castle O
with O
its O
garrison O
, O
which O
prevented O
anything O
like O
excess O
of O
violence O
or O
ill O
- O
doing O
. O

Burglaries B-ORG
, O
robberies O
, O
and O
murders O
even O
were O
no O
rarity O
; O
but O
assistance O
was O
always O
at O
hand O
when O
a O
brawl O
assumed O
too O
great O
dimensions O
. O

No O
band O
of O
robbers O
could O
come O
and O
levy O
contributions O
or O
commit O
other O
outrages O
as O
they O
did O
sometimes O
in O
smaller O
towns O
and O
villages O
. O

Thus O
this B-DATE
quarter I-DATE
of O
the O
town O
grew O
up O
and O
flourished O
as O
long O
as O
the O
war O
lasted O
. O

With O
the O
return O
of O
peace O
this O
prosperity O
waned O
, O
and O
soon O
departed O
altogether O
. O

The O
working O
part O
of O
the O
population O
moved O
away O
nearer O
the O
castle O
- O
walls O
and O
the O
old O
, O
established O
centre O
of O
business O
; O
and O
the O
disreputable O
part O
, O
finding O
their O
occupation O
gone O
, O
left O
for O
other O
regions O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
decades I-DATE
the O
place O
had O
become O
almost O
entirely O
deserted O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
houses O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
had O
been O
taken O
down O
and O
removed O
, O
some O
had O
been O
destroyed O
by O
fire O
, O
and O
not O
a O
few O
had O
fallen O
down O
, O
rotting O
away O
in O
unshapely O
heaps O
. O

All O
those O
that O
yet O
stood O
were O
in O
a O
state O
of O
extreme O
decay O
. O

Passing O
beggars O
and O
ronins O
often O
used O
them O
as O
a O
temporary O
refuge O
, O
and O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
real O
danger O
to O
unarmed O
wayfarers O
lurked O
under O
the O
shadow O
of O
this O
apparently O
deserted O
solitude O
. O

It O
was O
also O
a O
favorite O
spot O
for O
duels O
and O
night B-TIME
- O
brawls O
, O
and O
many O
a O
manly O
form O
was O
often O
found O
there O
in O
the O
morning O
lifeless O
and O
covered O
with O
sword O
- O
cuts O
. O

About B-DATE
nine I-DATE
years I-DATE
previous I-DATE
to O
the O
time O
when O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
incidents O
related O
in O
this O
narrative O
took O
place O
, O
Muramasa B-PERSON
the O
sword O
- O
smith O
, O
who O
had O
already O
acquired O
considerable O
reputation O
in O
his O
craft O
, O
arrived O
in O
Kuwana B-GPE
, O
and O
for O
a O
trifle O
bought O
a O
plot O
of O
land O
, O
where O
he O
erected O
his O
house O
in O
the O
manner O
already O
described O
. O

It O
was O
the O
worst O
- O
reputed O
part O
of O
the O
whole O
neighborhood O
, O
near O
the O
high O
road O
, O
which O
skirted O
one B-CARDINAL
end O
of O
the O
deserted O
village O
, O
and O
opposite O
to O
a O
large O
open O
, O
level O
space O
, O
where O
once O
had O
stood O
houses O
which O
had O
been O
burned O
down O
, O
and O
in O
whose O
place O
a O
plentiful O
supply O
of O
weeds O
had O
sprung O
up O
. O

These O
were O
, O
however O
, O
kept O
well O
beaten O
down O
; O
for O
it O
was O
this O
particular O
spot O
which O
was O
generally O
chosen O
when O
the O
brawlers O
or O
duellists O
fought O
in O
greater O
numbers O
. O

Muramasa B-PERSON
had O
been O
accompanied O
by O
a O
young O
wife O
, O
a O
son O
about B-DATE
fourteen I-DATE
years I-DATE
of I-DATE
age I-DATE
, O
the O
offspring O
of O
a O
former O
marriage O
, O
and O
an O
old O
married O
serving O
- O
couple O
. O

From O
the O
very O
beginning O
he O
had O
led O
a O
lonely O
and O
solitary O
life O
, O
as O
he O
did O
afterward O
. O

He O
repaired O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
old O
buildings O
on O
the O
land O
he O
had O
bought O
, O
so O
as O
to O
make O
it O
temporarily O
habitable O
while O
his O
new O
house O
was O
being O
constructed O
. O

His O
wife O
always O
remained O
utterly O
secluded O
; O
and O
even O
of O
the O
mechanics O
engaged O
by O
him O
to O
put O
up O
the O
new O
house O
, O
only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
got O
a O
passing O
glance O
at O
her O
through O
a O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
open O
door O
or O
window O
— O
sufficient O
, O
however O
, O
it O
seems O
, O
to O
make O
them O
speak O
in O
glowing O
terms O
of O
her O
marvellous O
beauty O
. O

Two B-DATE
years I-DATE
after O
her O
arrival O
she O
died O
in O
giving O
birth O
to O
a O
daughter O
, O
who O
was O
named O
O O
Tetsu O
. O

It O
then O
began O
to O
be O
bruited O
about O
that O
she O
had O
been O
an O
Eta B-ORG
( O
a O
pariah O
) O
, O
the O
queen O
of O
her O
tribe O
, O
famous O
for O
her O
surpassing O
loveliness O
. O

This O
report O
, O
which O
, O
it O
was O
said O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
originated O
with O
a O
travelling O
showman O
who O
had O
formerly O
known O
Muramasa B-PERSON
in O
other O
places O
, O
gradually O
assumed O
a O
more O
definite O
shape O
, O
and O
it O
was O
whispered O
that O
she O
had O
been O
rescued O
by O
the O
smith B-PERSON
while O
being O
abducted O
by O
some O
nobleman O
and O
carried O
to O
the O
latter O
’s O
castle O
. O

Rumor B-PERSON
went O
still O
further O
, O
and O
stated O
that O
it O
was O
not O
a O
man O
of O
low O
degree O
, O
but O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
mighty O
lords O
of O
the O
land O
who O
had O
attempted O
this O
outrage O
, O
and O
that O
six B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
most O
trusty O
blades O
engaged O
in O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
design O
had O
been O
cut O
down O
and O
disabled O
by O
the O
smith B-PERSON
who O
fought O
single O
- O
handed O
. O

Careless O
of O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
world O
, O
he O
afterward O
made O
the O
outcast O
Eta B-ORG
his O
lawful O
wife O
. O

He O
loved O
her O
fondly O
and O
passionately O
, O
and O
she O
reciprocated O
his O
sentiments O
. O

After O
her O
death O
, O
all O
that O
there O
was O
of O
kindness O
, O
of O
love O
, O
and O
of O
sympathy O
in O
his O
nature O
went O
out O
toward O
his O
daughter O
. O

To O
the O
outer O
world O
he O
became O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
more O
grim O
and O
reserved O
than O
he O
had O
been O
before O
. O

He O
shunned O
all O
such O
chance O
acquaintances O
as O
he O
had O
made O
, O
he O
went O
to O
the O
court O
— O
where O
even O
hitherto O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
an O
open O
invitation O
, O
he O
had O
rarely O
made O
his O
appearance O
— O
only O
when O
the O
occasion O
rendered O
his O
presence O
unavoidable O
; O
beyond O
this O
he O
paid O

received O
no O

The O
only O
persons O
who O
gained O
admittance O
to O
his O
house O
were O
a O

had O
engaged O
for O
his O

The O

three B-DATE

The O
smith B-PERSON
’s O
son O
, O
now O
a O
man O
over O
thirty B-DATE
years I-DATE
of I-DATE
age I-DATE
, O
resembled O
his O
father O
in O
outward O
looks O
and O
appearance O
, O
and O
if O
his O
face O
showed O
rather O
more O
good O
- O
humor O
, O
it O
was O
probably O
merely O
a O
negative O
quality O
arising O
from O
its O
lack O
of O
expression O
. O

Physically O
he O
was O
as O
strong O
and O
stout O
as O
the O
smith O
; O
but O
his O
mind O
was O
of O
a O
very O
inferior O
order O
. O

He O
was O
, O
however O
, O
an O
expert O
in O
all O
that O
pertained O
to O
swords O
; O
and O
on O
this O
point O
could O
discourse O
pleasantly O
and O
with O
an O
intelligence O
that O
sometimes O
bordered O
on O
eloquence O
. O

As O
regarded O
everything O
else O
, O
his O
mental O
and O
reasoning O
faculties O
seemed O
to O
present O
a O
perfect O
blank O
, O
he O
being O
unable O
to O
understand O
causes O
and O
effects O
, O
unless O
they O
were O
of O
the O
most O
simple O
kind O
, O
such O
as O
could O
be O
learned O
mechanically O
. O

For O
his O
father O
he O
showed O
great O
awe O
and O
reverence O
, O
and O
toward O
his O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
sister O
he O
evinced O
an O
affection O
which O
was O
as O
deep O
as O
it O
was O
humble O
, O
and O
might O
be O
likened O
to O
that O
of O
a O
faithful O
dog O
. O

He O
displayed O
it O
by O
a O
desire O
to O
be O
close O
to O
her O
in O
those O
short O
periods O
when O
he O
was O
not O
engaged O
in O
work O
. O

At O
such O
times O
he O
would O
often O
put O
his O
hand O
furtively O
but O
tenderly O
on O
some O
part O
of O
her O
dress O
; O
and O
when O
she O
perceived O
it O
, O
he O
would O
bend O
forward O
, O
as O
if O
waiting O
for O
a O
smile O
or O
a O
caressing O
word O
, O
which O
were O
the O
usual O
acknowledgments O
, O
and O
to O
which O
, O
when O
given O
, O
his O
only O
response O
was O
a O
broad O
, O
pleased O
grin O
. O

He O
rarely O
spoke O
on O
anything O
not O
connected O
with O
his O
craft O
, O
but O
to O
express O
his O
wants O
and O
feelings O
used O
certain O
signs O
, O
which O
those O
about O
him O
had O
learned O
to O
interpret O
. O

He O
might O
almost O
have O
passed O
for O
an O
idiot O
, O
were O
it O
not O
for O
his O
clear O
, O
logical O
talk O
on O
everything O
connected O
with O
his O
profession O
, O
and O
for O
a O
quickness O
of O
movement O
of O
both O
hand O
and O
limb O
which O
such O
beings O
do O
not O
usually O
possess O
, O
and O
which O
in O
him O
was O
developed O
to O
a O
remarkable O
degree O
. O

It O
is O
probable O
that O
he O
was O
naturally O
endowed O
with O
but O
limited O
reasoning O
powers O
. O

These O
, O
however O
, O
would O
have O
been O
sufficient O
for O
the O
narrow O
range O
of O
views O
and O
the O
limited O
routine O
duties O
of O
a O
peasant O
or O
a O
laborer O
in O
those B-DATE
days I-DATE
; O
but O
in O
the O
position O
in O
which O
he O
was O
placed O
, O
the O
comparatively O
strong O
claims O
made O
upon O
him O
in O
the O
exercise O
of O
his O
profession O
had O
, O
so O
to O
say O
, O
absorbed O
all O
that O
there O
was O
of O
intellect O
and O
drawn O
it O
into O
this O
one B-CARDINAL
channel O
, O
leaving O
everything O
else O
a O
blank O
. O

CHAPTER O
IV O
. O

Under O
such O
surroundings O
grew O
up O
the O
fairest O
maiden O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
province O
of O
Kuwana B-GPE
. O

All O
who O
had O
seen O
her O
were O
unanimous O
in O
according O
this O
tribute O
to O
O O
Tetsu O
. O

The O
people O
often O
wondered O
how O
such O
a O
beautiful O
, O
lovely O
being O
could O
spring O
from O
such O
a O
coarse O
, O
knotted O
stock O
, O
even O
when O
her O
mother O
’s O
fair O
, O
delicate O
nature O
was O
grafted O
upon O
it O
. O

There O
are O
many O
points O
of O
beauty O
for O
which O
the O
daughters O
of O
Japan B-GPE
have O
always O
been O
favored O
beyond O
those O
of O
most O
other O
nations O
. O

In O
no O
country O
probably O
will O
there O
be O
found O
so O
many O
possessing O
those O
delicate O
hands O
and O
feet O
, O
that O
gloriously O
beautiful O
neck O
, O
and O
those O
bright O
, O
shining O
eyes O
which O
seem O
to O
be O
the O
birth O
- O
right O
of O
the O
maidens O
of O
the O
Land O
of O
the O
Rising O
Sun O
. O

All O
these O
advantages O
and O
many O
others O
were O
found O
to O
perfection O
in O
O O
Tetsu O
; O
and O
she O
added O
to O
them O
a O
grace O
of O
movement O
and O
a O
witchery O
of O
manner O
which O
caused O
the O
poets O
of O
the O
court O
to O
lament O
the O
poverty O
of O
their O
language O
, O
because O
it O
failed O
to O
supply O
them O
with O
adequate O
terms O
to O
describe O
all O
these O
endearing O
qualities O
to O
their O
satisfaction O
. O

Fair O
and O
fresh O
and O
beautiful O
as O
a O
summer B-DATE
morn O
, O
graceful O
as O
a O
Japanese B-NORP
lily O
, O
with O
wonderful O
eyes O
, O
lustrous O
and O
brilliant O
, O
and O
shining O
with O
a O
peculiar O
humid O
brightness O
which O
suffused O
or O
rather O
covered O
them O
as O
if O
with O
a O
refulgent O
and O
yet O
a O
transparent O
veil O
, O
and O
with O
a O
voice O
whose O
sweet O
melody O
, O
if O
you O
were O
young O
and O
impressionable O
, O
lingered O
in O
your O
ears O
for O
days B-DATE
and O
weeks B-DATE
after O
you O
heard O
it O
, O
O O
Tetsu O
might O
well O
lay O
claim O
to O
be O
considered O
peerless O
throughout O
the O
land O
. O

Her O
hands O
and O
feet O
might O
have O
belonged O
to O
a O
child O
half O
her O
age O
, O
and O
her O
form O
was O
slight O
and O
delicate O
; O
yet O
she O
was O
no O
tender O
, O
hothouse O
plant O
, O
but O
in O
reality O
strong O
and O
robust O
. O

When O
on O
cold O
, O
frosty O
winter B-DATE
mornings B-TIME
, O
the O
ground O
being O
covered O
with O
snow O
, O
she O
walked O
out O
with O
her O
bare O
feet O
thrust O
into O
high O
- O
heeled O
getas B-ORG
, O
her O
rich O
, O
warm O
blood O
mantling O
neck O
and O
face O
, O
she O
looked O
a O
picture O
of O
physical O
health O
, O
and O
formed O
a O
striking O
contrast O
to O
many O
damsels O
whose O
coarser O
build O
did O
not O
prevent O
them O
from O
shivering O
, O
and O
showing O
hands O
and O
feet O
and O
noses O
that O
were O
blue O
and O
ugly O
with O
the O
cold O
. O

In O
spite O
of O
her O
generally O
mild O
and O
demure O
looks O
, O
there O
was O
something O
of O
her O
father O
’s O
nature O
in O
her O
after O
all O
— O
a O
certain O
imperious O
way O
, O
which O
, O
rarely O
displayed O
, O
might O
have O
been O
taken O
for O
a O
faint O
, O
a O
very O
faint O
, O
counterpart O
of O
the O
old O
smith B-PERSON
’s O
headstrong O
obstinacy O
. O

There O
was O
some O
slight O
resemblance O
between O
them O
also O
in O
outward O
looks O
— O
a O
resemblance O
in O
general O
hardly O
conceivable O
, O
but O
which O
became O
apparent O
in O
O O
Tetsu O
when O
her O
eyes O
were O
momentarily O
closed O
. O

Then O
her O
small O
mouth O
and O
chin O
showed O
its O
resolute O
cast O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
outline O
of O
the O
face O
was O
not O
lacking O
in O
a O
certain O
determined O
look O
, O
which O
, O
as O
shrewd O
observers O
said O
, O
would O
have O
developed O
into O
something O
of O
a O
temper O
if O
circumstances O
had O
favored O
it O
. O

All O
these O
latent O
traits O
, O
however O
, O
were O
not O
visible O
, O
or O
failed O
to O
be O
noticed O
, O
when O
you O
saw O
her O
eyes O
— O
those O
beautiful O
eyes O
, O
with O
their O
unfathomable O
depth O
of O
bright O
, O
roguish O
tenderness O
. O

Although O
her O
father O
doted O
on O
her O
, O
yet O
the O
stern O
, O
fierce O
nature O
of O
his O
strong O
and O
powerful O
individuality O
rendered O
disobedience O
or O
self O
- O
willed O
pertinacity O
an O
impossibility O
, O
and O
the O
girl O
’s O
feminine O
graces O
were O
thus O
saved O
from O
being O
marred O
by O
tendencies O
which O
a O
different O
education O
might O
have O
aggravated O
into O
faults O
. O

Young O
as O
O O
Tetsu O
was O
, O
offers O
of O
marriage O
— O
some O
of O
them O
of O
a O
kind O
to O
satisfy O
very O
exacting O
demands O
on O
the O
score O
of O
birth O
, O
family O
, O
position O
, O
and O
personal O
accomplishments O
— O
had O
not O
been O
wanting O
. O

There O
were O
those O
who O
would O
have O
wooed O
her O
for O
her O
father O
’s O
reputed O
wealth O
; O
there O
were O
others O
, O
and O
probably O
the O
greater O
number O
, O
who O
were O
attracted O
mostly O
by O
the O
charms O
of O
her O
person O
and O
manners O
; O
while O
not O
a O
few O
of O
high O
position O
and O
noble O
birth O
would O
have O
been O
content O
to O
give O
her O
their O
name O
if O
she O
had O
possessed O
neither O
beauty O
nor O
wealth O
, O
being O
actuated O
by O
the O
sole O
hope O
of O
getting O
one O
of O
her O
father O
’s O
swords O
as O
a O
dowry O
. O

The O
social O
taint O
attaching O
to O
her O
escutcheon O
on O
account O
of O
her O
reputed O
Eta B-ORG
mother O
, O
the O
mere O
suspicion O
of O
which O
in O
the O
case O
of O
most O
others O
would O
have O
been O
an O
all O
- O
powerful O
objection O
, O
not O
to O
be O
outweighed O
by O
the O
possession O
of O
wealth O
, O
was O
disregarded O
in O
the O
daughter O
of O
this O
clever O
artisan O
. O

In O
her O
it O
would O
have O
been O
condoned O
, O
even O
if O
it O
had O
stood O
out O
as O
a O
well O
- O
known O
and O
established O
fact O
. O

This O
, O
however O
, O
was O
not O
the O
case O
, O
as O
it O
was O
after O
all O
but O
a O
vague O
report O
, O
which O
anybody O
who O
chose O
might O
disbelieve O
. O

The O
lovers O
of O
O O
Tetsu O
looked O
for O
no O
other O
reason O
to O
ignore O
its O
existence O
but O
their O
own O
desire O
and O
inclination O
; O
while O
the O
smith O
’s O
fame O
, O
his O
reputed O
influence O
, O
which O
it O
was O
known O
would O
carry O
great O
weight O
if O
he O
chose O
to O
exert O
it O
, O
and O
above O
all O
the O
secret O
superstitious O
awe O
which O
he O
inspired O
, O
were O
so O
many O
deterrent O
influences O
to O
prevent O
people O
from O
talking O
above O
their O
breath O
of O
what O
might O
be O
distasteful O
to O
him O
if O
it O
should O
reach O
his O
ears O
. O

This O
fear O
and O
awe O
had O
its O
origin O
in O
another O
of O
those O
rumors O
which O
arise O
no O
one O
knows O
how O
or O
when O
, O
and O
which O
sometimes O
, O
having O
a O
substratum O
of O
truth O
, O
or O
assuming O
its O
semblance O
from O
accidental O
circumstances O
, O
come O
to O
be O
accepted O
as O
undoubted O
facts O
. O

In O
this O
instance O
it O
had O
long O
since O
been O
so O
accepted O
. O

It O
was O
said O
that O
in O
the O
manufacture O
of O
his O
swords O
the O
smith O
needed O
newly O
- O
shed O
human O
blood O
. O

The O
age O
was O
superstitious O
enough O
to O
believe O
that O
such O
a O
procedure O
correctly O
carried O
out O
would O
entail O
marvellous O
results O
; O
and O
the O
wonderful O
excellence O
of O
Muramasa B-PERSON
’s O
productions O
favored O
this O
reasoning O
. O

There O
were O
sufficient O
grounds O
beside O
to O
make O
such O
a O
belief O
plausible O
. O

The O
smith B-PERSON
’s O
weird O
appearance O
and O
manner O
, O
and O
the O
dreary O
, O
lonely O
character O
of O
the O
neighborhood O
wherein O
he O
lived O
, O
had O
undoubtedly O
contributed O
to O
this O
end O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
dead O
bodies O
which O
were O
found O
so O
often O
near O
his O
house O
— O
much O
more O
frequently O
, O
it O
was O
said O
, O
than O
ever O
before O
— O
whether O
they O
had O
belonged O
to O
samurai O
slain O
in O
brawl O
or O
duel O
, O
merchants O
robbed O
and O
killed O
for O
their O
money O
or O
beggars O
probably O
cut O
down O
from O
mere O
wanton O
lust O
, O
were O
always O
cut O
and O
slashed O
in O
a O
terrible O
manner O
, O
leaving O
hardly O
any O
blood O
in O
the O
body O
, O
while O
traces O
of O
it O
were O
often O
found O
suspiciously O
near O
the O
smith O
’s O
dwelling O
. O

Nobody O
thought O
of O
accusing O
the O
latter O
of O
sordid O
motives O
, O
and O
his O
solitary O
life O
prevented O
him O
from O
having O
many O
enemies O
. O

It O
was O
only O
the O
blood O
he O
wanted O
to O
temper O
his O
steel O
; O
and O
when O
the O
time O
came O
that O
he O
needed O
it O
, O
and O
no O
accident O
supplied O
him O
, O
then O
, O
as O
people O
said O
, O
he O
took O
care O
to O
furnish O
an O
accident O
himself O
. O

If O
such O
had O
been O
the O
case O
, O
known O
and O
proven O
, O
it O
would O
probably O
have O
entailed O
no O
unpleasant O
consequences O
upon O
the O
smith O
, O
unless O
some O
one O
, O
specially O
interested O
and O
high O
in O
authority O
, O
had O
chosen O
to O
take O
the O
matter O
in O
hand O
. O

Human O
life O
was O
held O
cheap O
enough O
, O
while O
good O
swords O
were O
rare O
; O
and O
if O
it O
required O
human O
blood O
to O
make O
one O
, O
a O
few O
merchants O
and O
vagrants O
could O
well O
be O
spared O
. O

Muramasa B-PERSON
himself O
was O
doubtless O
aware O
of O
this O
report O
, O
and O
was O
even O
believed O
by O
some O
to O
encourage O
it O
. O

At O
least O
, O
whether O
true O
in O
any O
degree O
or O
altogether O
a O
fabrication O
, O
he O
never O
by O
word O
or O
sign O
contradicted O
it O
; O
he O
probably O
had O
enough O
worldly O
wisdom O
to O
know O
that O
the O
atmosphere O
of O
dread O
mystery O
in O
which O
, O
by O
common O
report O
, O
he O
thus O
lived O
, O
created O
a O
spell O
which O
could O
not O
but O
enhance O
the O
value O
of O
the O
products O
of O
his O
marvellous O
handicraft O
. O

As O
far O
as O
O O
Tetsu O
was O
concerned O
, O
none O
of O
these O
rumors O
had O
ever O
reached O
her O
. O

It O
was O
known O
that O
in O
her O
case O
the B-PERSON
smith I-PERSON
objected O
to O
and O
would O
resent O
such O
a O
piece O
of O
tale O
- O
bearing O
; O
and O
the O
mysterious O
fear O
of O
him O
was O
sufficient O
to O
prevent O
anything O
of O
the O
kind O
. O

Once O
only O
had O
such O
an O
attempt O
been O
made O
. O

As O
the O
girl O
one B-CARDINAL
forenoon O
passed O
out O
of O
the O
house O
on O
her O
way O
to O
the O
town O
to O
make O
a O
few O
purchases O
, O
accompanied O
, O
as O
she O
always O
was O
, O
by O
her O
old O
servant O
, O
she O
was O
stopped O
not O
far O
from O
her O
door O
by O
two B-CARDINAL
old O
beldames O
with O
whom O
she O
had O
a O
slight O
acquaintance O
. O

The O
latter O
had O
been O
loitering O
under O
pretence O
of O
looking O
at O
some O
tumble O
- O
down O
buildings O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
street O
, O
to O
which O
both O
of O
them O
pointed O
now O
and O
then O
in O
apparently O
a O
deeply O
interested O
way O
; O
in O
reality O
, O
however O
, O
they O
were O
waiting O
, O
hoping O
perhaps O
to O
meet O
the O
smith B-PERSON
’s O
daughter O
, O
who O
went O
out O
only B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
three B-CARDINAL
times O
a O
month O
, O
but O
generally O
at O
this B-TIME
hour I-TIME
. O

It O
was O
not O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
that O
these O
women O
, O
who O
were O
known O
as O
confirmed O
gossips O
, O
had O
been O
seen O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
; O
but O
they O
had O
never O
before O
met O
the O
young O
girl O
, O
whom O
, O
when O
they O
saw O
her O
now O
, O
they O
accosted O
with O
such O
a O
show O
of O
affection O
and O
caressing O
words O
that O
she O
could O
not O
but O
stop O
and O
make O
some O
sort O
of O
reply O
. O

As O
the O
conversation O
continued O
, O
however O
, O
she O
, O
knowing O
that O
her O
father O
objected O
strongly O
to O
anything O
like O
street O
gossip O
, O
became O
uneasy O
and O
bent O
a O
significant O
look O
on O
her O
servant O
. O

The O
latter O
, O
who O
in O
general O
was O
quick O
enough O
in O
her O
perceptions O
, O
and O
of O
her O
own O
accord O
had O
often O
stopped O
such O
rencontres O
, O
sometimes O
in O
a O
very O
abrupt O
and O
unceremonious O
manner O
, O
seemed O
in O
this O
instance O
unable O
to O
understand O
the O
meaning O
of O
her O
young O
mistress O
’s O
uneasiness O
, O
and O
, O
contrary O
to O
all O
her O
habits O
, O
even O
took O
a O
lively O
interest O
in O
the O
conversation O
. O

“ O
Miss O
O O
Tetsu O
is O
getting O
to O
be O
very O
proud O
now O
, O
” O
said O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
women O
, O
the O
wife O
of O
a O
small O
sugar O
- O
baker O
, O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
conversation O
which O
followed O
numerous B-TIME
minute I-TIME
inquiries O
after O
the O
other O
’s O
health O
. O

“ O
Yet O
when O
you O
were O
a O
child O
you O
never O
passed O
our O
poor O
, O
humble O
place O
without O
calling O
for O
your O
candy O
, O
which O
I O
took O
so O
much O
pleasure O
in O
giving O
to O
the O
dear O
, O
pretty O
little O
thing O
. O
” O

“ O
Oh O
, O
yes O
! O
” O

her O
companion O
, O
the O
shrewish O
spouse O
of O
an O
omochaya O
( O
dealer O
in O
toys O
) O
, O
chimed O
in O
, O
“ O
and O
at O
that O
time O
she O
rarely O
passed O
our O
place O
without O
accepting O
some O
little O
toy O
or O
plaything O
; O
and O
bless O
her O
little O
heart O
, O
how O
she O
did O
enjoy O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
picture O
- O
books O
, O
and O
the O
tops O
which O
she O
began O
to O
spin O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
passed O
out O
into O
the O
street O
! O

But O
Miss O
O O
Tetsu O
has O
become O
a O
great O
lady O
now O
, O
with O
more O
beauty O
and O
wealth O
than O
any O
other O
girl O
in O
the O
province O
, O
and O
poor O
people O
like O
us O
can O
hardly O
expect O
to O
be O
noticed O
by O
her O
. O
” O

“ O
You O
are O
both O
certainly O
mistaken O
, O
” O
replied O
O O
Tetsu O
, O
vexed O
with O
the O
others O
as O
well O
as O
herself O
. O

She O
could O
not O
understand O
the O
meaning O
of O
all O
this O
talk O
; O
she O
only O
remembered O
going O
to O
these O
women O
’s O
shops O
, O
as O
she O
went O
to O
others O
, O
to O
make O
occasional O
purchases O
, O
and O
she O
was O
at O
a O
loss O
to O
account O
for O
this O
fervor O
and O
extreme O
show O
of O
friendly O
sympathy O
. O

Still O
, O
above O
everything O
she O
would O
not O
be O
thought O
proud O
or O
unkind O
to O
inferiors O
, O
and O
so O
she O
continued O
: O
“ O
I O
am O
not O
a O
child O
any O
more O
, O
and O
do O
not O
now O
care O
for O
sweetmeats O
or O
toys O
; O
but O
I O
do O
not O
mean O
to O
forget O
any O
kindness O
done O
to O
me O
, O
and O
if O
you O
care O
for O
my O
company O
, O
I O
will O
call O
upon O
you O
the O
next O
time O
I O
go O
out O
. O
” O

“ O
I O
knew O
it O
; O
I O
knew O
what O
a O
kind O
- O
hearted O
and O
good O
- O
natured O
little O
fairy O
you O
are O
, O
” O
the O
former O
speaker O
quickly O
and O
rather O
illogically O
rejoined O
. O

“ O
And O
how O
is O
your O
dear O
father O
? O
” O

she O
continued O
abruptly O
, O
noticing O
the O
other O
’s O
impatience O
to O
get O
away O
. O

“ O
I O
have O
not O
seen O
my O
father O
for O
some B-DATE
days I-DATE
; O
he O
is O
finishing O
a O
sword O
now O
, O
and O
at O
such O
times O
he O
always O
shuts O
himself O
up O
with O
my O
brother O
in O
the O
smithy O
, O
allowing O
not O
even O
me O
to O
disturb O
him O
. O
” O

“ O
So O
now O
is O
the O
time O
when O
your O
father O
is O
finishing O
one O
of O
his O
wonderful O
swords O
? O

I O
ought O
to O
have O
known O
it O
. O

They O
found O
two B-CARDINAL
corpses O
fearfully O
hacked O
to O
pieces O
on O
the O
lot O
opposite O
to O
you O
. O

Strange O
— O
is O
it O
not?—but O
at O
such O
times O
corpses O
are O
always O
found O
over O
there O
. O

Strange O
, O
is O
it O
not O
, O
Miss O
O O
Tetsu O
? O
” O

“ O
There O
is O
nothing O
strange O
about O
it O
, O
” O
the O
old O
servant O
here O
quickly O
spoke O
up O
. O

“ O
When O
Muramasa B-PERSON
is O
engaged O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
swords O
, O
he O
is O
utterly O
absorbed O
in O
his O
work O
, O
and O
robbers O
and O
thieves O
know O
they O
need O
not O
fear O
his O
interference O
; O
so O
they O
pursue O
their O
evil O
ways O
without O
danger O
of O
being O
disturbed O
by O
one O
who O
would O
be O
a O
match O
for O
a B-CARDINAL
dozen I-CARDINAL
of O
them O
. O
” O

“ O
I O
suppose O
that O
may O
be O
it O
, O
” O
was O
the O
response O
, O
slowly O
given O
. O

“ O
We O
think O
, O
however O
, O
at O
such O
a O
time O
the O
smithy O
could O
show O
many O
strange O
and O
queer O
, O
perhaps O
some O
fearful O
, O
scenes O
, O
and O
I O
would O
give O
anything O
to O
be O
able O
to O
get O
a O
glance O
at O
it O
to O
- O
day O
. O
” O

“ O
I O
will O
afford O
you O
that O
pleasure O
, O
” O
said O
a O
deep O
, O
harsh O
voice O
; O
and O
turning O
round O
, O
the O
woman O
who O
had O
spoken O
saw O
the O
smith B-PERSON
himself O
at O
her O
elbow O
. O

The O
sight O
of O
him O
at O
that O
moment O
would O
have O
appalled O
even O
a O
strong O
, O
stout O
- O
hearted O
man O
, O
much O
more O
the O
shrinking O
creature O
whom O
he O
had O
just O
addressed O
. O

His O
mouth O
was O
firmly O
compressed O
, O
his O
face O
looked O
unnaturally O
broad O
, O
and O
its O
repulsive O
features O
new O
seemed O
perfectly O
hideous O
, O
with O
the O
coal O
- O
dust O
and O
soot O
which O
covered O
them O
as O
well O
as O
his O
whole O
body O
. O

The O
furrow O
on O
his O
forehead O
was O
filled O
with O
this O
floating O
dust O
, O
and O
glistening O
with O
the O
great O
drops O
of O
sweat O
that O
had O
gathered O
there O
, O
had O
become O
a O
shining O
jet O
black O
. O

But O
the O
worst O
feature O
of O
all O
were O
those O
large O
, O
restless O
, O
glaring O
eyes O
, O
surrounded O
as O
they O
now O
were O
with O
red O
, O
inflamed O
brows O
, O
which O
spoke O
of O
long O
nights O
of O
watching O
and O
labor O
. O

“ O
You O
can O
go O
on O
now O
, O
O O
Tetsu O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
addressing O
his O
daughter O
, O
“ O
while O
I O
take O
charge O
of O
these O
ladies O
. O

Go O
on O
, O
” O
he O
continued O
in O
a O
more O
peremptory O
way O
, O
as O
the O
other O
loitered O
; O
“ O
I O
must O
fulfil O
the O
wish O
of O
these O
ladies O
who O
have O
such O
very O
kind O
feelings O
for O
you O
and O
me O
; O
” O
and O
taking O
hold O
of O
each O
by O
an O
arm O
, O
he O
led O
them O
along O
, O
while O
the O
girl O
, O
unaccustomed O
to O
hear O
severe O
tones O
from O
him O
, O
hurried O
away O
with O
her O
servant O
. O

What O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
gossips O
who O
were O
now O
led O
away O
into O
the O
smithy O
heard O
or O
saw O
there O
, O
they O
could O
or O
would O
never O
give O
a O
rational O
account O
of O
. O

They O
were O
both O
in O
such O
a O
state O
of O
abject O
fear O
and O
terror O
that O
the O
smith O
had O
to O
change O
his O
hold O
from O
their O
arms O
to O
their O
waists O
to O
bring O
them O
to O
his O
place O
, O
which O
was O
only B-QUANTITY
a I-QUANTITY
few I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
away O
. O

They O
remembered O
the O
smithy O
— O
large O
, O
dark O
, O
and O
gloomy O
, O
all O
the O
darker O
and O
gloomier O
for O
the O
contrast O
with O
the O
bright O
air O
and O
light O
outside O
. O

They O
remembered O
seeing O
a O
hot O
, O
lurid O
fire O
at O
one B-CARDINAL
end O
, O
before O
which O
the O
smith O
’s O
son O
was O
working O
half B-CARDINAL
naked O
with O
an O
immense O
hammer O
on O
a O
white O
- O
hot O
bar O
of O
iron O
. O

All O
around O
him O
were O
numberless O
tools O
and O
instruments O
with O
sharp O
edges O
and O
bright O
surfaces O
glistening O
in O
the O
glare O
of O
the O
flame O
, O
which O
came O
out O
with O
a O
hissing O
noise O
. O

The O
place O
also O
contained O
a O
quantity O
of O
large O
and O
small O
tubs O
, O
some O
apparently O
empty O
, O
and O
some O
containing O
liquid O
which O
looked O
black O
as O
tar O
, O
but O
which O
, O
when O
the O
firelight O
fell O
upon O
it O
, O
shone O
red O
as O
blood O
. O

Queer O
and O
fantastic O
shadows O
, O
which O
elongated O
or O
contracted O
as O
the O
flame O
on O
the O
hearth O
shot O
out O
or O
subsided O
, O
filled O
the O
place O
. O

Half B-CARDINAL
- O
dead O
with O
terror O
, O
they O
remembered O
being O
led O
, O
or O
rather O
carried O
, O
by O
the O
smith O
close O
to O
the O
fiery O
heat O
, O
and O
they O
had O
a O
dim O
recollection O
of O
being O
told O
by O
him O
how O
a O
human O
being O
could O
be O
burned O
to O
cinders O
here O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
moments I-TIME
, O
and O
how O
those O
cinders O
could O
be O
put O
to O
use O
again O
in O
forging O
a O
sword O
. O

An O
idle O
vagrant O
unwilling O
to O
work O
, O
or O
a O
good O
- O
for O
- O
nothing O
, O
peeping O
, O
spying O
chatterbox O
, O
who O
neglected O
her O
home O
but O
minded O
everybody O
’s O
business O
, O
could O
hardly O
be O
put O
to O
any O
better O
use O
than O
this O
. O

The O
terrible O
heat O
, O
and O
partly O
their O
own O
feelings O
, O
must O
have O
overpowered O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
beldames O
, O
for O
they O
remembered O
nothing O
further O
until O
they O
found O
themselves O
out O
in O
the O
yard O
by O
the O
well O
, O
drenched O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
with O
several O
buckets O
of O
water O
which O
the O
smith O
had O
thrown O
over O
them O
. O

With O
a O
grim O
smile O
he O
said O
he O
thought O
they O
were O
satisfied O
with O
their O
visit O
; O
and O
while O
he O
gave O
it O
as O
his O
opinion O
that O
the O
air O
of O
the O
smithy O
hardly O
agreed O
with O
them O
, O
he O
added O
that O
if O
he O
ever O
heard O
of O
their O
expressing O
any O
further O
curiosity O
, O
he O
would O
certainly O
be O
ready O
to O
contrive O
means O
of O
giving O
them O
another O
glimpse O
of O
his O
workshop O
. O

Then O
, O
without O
further O
ceremony O
, O
he O
conducted O
them O
to O
the O
gate O
, O
which O
he O
closed O
in O
their O
faces O
, O
leaving O
the O
poor O
drenched O
women O
, O
chattering O
with O
cold O
and O
still O
shaking O
and O
quaking O
with O
fright O
, O
to O
find O
their O
way O
home O
as O
best O
they O
could O
. O

It O
was O
said O
that O
from O
this B-DATE
day I-DATE
the O
henpecked O
omochaya O
found O
his O
wife O
marvellously O
changed O
for O
the O
better O
. O

Queerly O
enough O
, O
although O
neither O
of O
them O
spoke O
of O
their O
adventure O
, O
the O
affair O
gradually O
came O
to O
be O
known O
and O
talked O
about O
; O
and O
the O
guarded O
, O
evasive O
answers O
which O
, O
although O
otherwise O
voluble O
enough O
, O
they O
gave O
when O
interrogated O
by O
their O
acquaintances O
, O
only O
heightened O
the O
interest O
without O
satisfying O
it O
, O
thereby O
giving O
new O
food O
for O
mysterious O
tales O
about O
the O
smith O
. O

CHAPTER O
V. O

Among O
those O
who O
were O
smitten O
by O
O O
Tetsu B-ORG
’s O
charms O
was O
no O
less O
a O
person O
than O
the O
old O
Duke O
Ono B-PERSON
ga I-PERSON
Sawa I-PERSON
himself O
. O

Being O
already O
married O
, O
he O
could O
only O
offer O
her O
the O
position O
of O
first B-ORDINAL
concubine O
— O
which O
, O
however O
, O
in O
Japan B-GPE
implies O
nothing O
of O
dishonor O
and O
very O
little O
even O
of O
inferiority O
. O

The O
position O
of O
a O
first B-ORDINAL
concubine O
, O
or O
second B-ORDINAL
wife O
, O
as O
she O
is O
sometimes O
called O
( O
and O
even O
that O
of O
those O
who O
follow O
her O
) O
, O
is O
a O
legitimate O
one O
, O
recognized O
by O
law O
and O
custom O
. O

She O
ranks O
next O
to O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
wife O
; O
and O
if O
the O
latter O
fail O
to O
bear O
male O
children O
, O
the O
concubine O
’s O
son O
succeeds O
to O
his O
father O
’s O
titles O
and O
honors O
. O

With O
the O
exception O
, O
perhaps O
, O
of O
two B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
three B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
very O
highest O
families O
, O
there O
were O
none O
in O
the O
province O
but O
would O
have O
been O
greatly O
pleased O
and O
gratified O
at O
such O
an O
offer O
for O
their O
daughter O
. O

Still O
, O
the O
Duke B-ORG
was O
hardly O
sanguine O
, O
for O
a O
few O
hints O
to O
this O
effect O
conveyed O
to O
Muramasa B-PERSON
had O
fallen O
upon O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
very O
unresponsive O
soil O
. O

Forced O
to O
act O
more O
directly O
, O
he O
appointed O
a O
duly O
accredited O
nakōdō O
. O

For O
this O
office O
he O
selected O
— O
doubtless O
purposely O
— O
a O
superannuated O
court O
noble O
living O
in O
retirement O
upon O
a O
small O
pension O
, O
and O
who O
, O
although O
aware O
of O
the O
smith B-PERSON
’s O
merit O
, O
was O
yet O
only O
partially O
acquainted O
with O
his O
position O
and O
pretensions O
. O

This O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
ill O
success O
which O
had O
attended O
all O
others O
who O
had O
preceded O
him O
on O
similar O
errands O
, O
he O
only O
learned O
when O
, O
flushed O
with O
pride O
, O
he O
informed O
— O
in O
strict O
privacy O
, O
of O
course O
— O
some O
of O
his O
younger O
court O
friends O
of O
his O
appointment O
. O

Their O
responses O
, O
unanimous O
as O
they O
all O
were O
, O
sadly O
dampened O
his O
expectation O
of O
a O
quiet O
and O
successful O
issue O
to O
his O
mission O
, O
and O
clouded O
his O
hopes O
of O
the O
benefits O
and O
advantages O
which O
would O
result O
therefrom O
, O
not O
to O
speak O
of O
the O
Muramasa B-PERSON
sword O
, O
which O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
flush O
of O
sanguine O
excitement O
the O
envoy O
felt O
certain O
of O
receiving O
from O
the O
man O
to O
whom O
he O
offered O
such O
an O
eligible O
position O
for O
his O
daughter O
. O

He O
almost O
began O
to O
regret O
that O
he O
had O
been O
chosen O
by O
the O
Duke B-ORG
. O

Still O
, O
having O
once O
accepted O
the O
duty O
, O
he O
had O
no O
choice O
; O
and O
trusting O
not O
a O
little O
to O
his O
own O
power O
of O
persuasion O
, O
he O
started O
on O
his O
errand O
. O

Contrary O
to O
precedent O
, O
and O
far O
in O
excess O
of O
anything O
he O
anticipated O
, O
he O
was O
extremely O
well O
received O
. O

His O
host O
, O
who O
could O
not O
but O
be O
aware O
of O
his O
errand O
, O
at O
once O
invited O
him O
into O
the O
best O
room O
. O

Tea O
and O
wine O
were O
brought O
in O
; O
and O
as O
in O
Eastern B-NORP
countries O
the O
matter O
in O
hand O
is O
never O
immediately O
introduced O
, O
but O
only O
approached O
gradually O
, O
other O
subjects O
, O
and O
naturally O
swords O
, O
were O
discussed O
first B-ORDINAL
— O
and O
last O
. O

The O
host O
, O
usually O
so O
sparing O
of O
his O
words O
, O
seemed O
this B-DATE
day I-DATE
to O
put O
no O
restraint O
on O
his O
tongue O
. O

Every O
attempt O
on O
the O
part O
of O
his O
visitor O
to O
approach O
the O
matter O
that O
had O
brought O
him O
to O
Senjuin B-PERSON
was O
the O
signal O
for O
Muramasa B-PERSON
to O
recount O
the O
story O
of O
some O
glowing O
feat O
of O
arms O
, O
of O
some O
wonderful O
exploit O
of O
Japan B-GPE
’s O
great O
heroes O
, O
or O
of O
some O
marvellous O
piece O
of O
fencing O
or O
swordsmanship O
. O

The O
enthusiasm O
naturally O
engendered O
by O
such O
subjects O
, O
not O
unmixed O
with O
anxiety O
and O
a O
lingering O
fear O
that O
his O
object O
was O
in O
no O
way O
furthered O
by O
what O
he O
could O
not O
help O
listening O
to O
with O
pleasure O
and O
even O
with O
rapture O
, O
caused O
the O
envoy O
to O
resort O
to O
the O
wine O
- O
cup O
more O
frequently O
than O
agreed O
with O
the O
sober O
habits O
which O
a O
small O
income O
necessarily O
imposed O
. O

He O
did O
this O
with O
such O
effect O
that O
in O
the O
course O
of O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours I-TIME
he O
had O
completely O
forgotten O
the O
object O
of O
his O
mission O
. O

He O
began O
to O
entertain O
the O
smith O
with O
an O
heroic O
recital O
of O
the O
exploits O
of O
his O
own O
youth O
, O
which O
with O
every O
succeeding O
cup O
trenched O
more O
and O
more O
on O
the O
marvellous O
; O
and O
when O
at O
last O
he O
took O
his O
leave O
, O
being O
escorted O
to O
the O
door O
by O
his O
host O
, O
he O
was O
still O
talking O
and O
gesticulating O
, O
although O
in O
a O
confused O
way O
, O
and O
the O
servant O
who O
had O
accompanied O
him O
found O
it O
difficult O
to O
induce O
him O
to O
enter O
his O
chair O
. O

When O
soberness O
and O
consciousness O
returned O
, O
his O
mortification O
was O
so O
great O
that O
he O
could O
not O
bring O
himself O
again O
to O
face O
the O
smith O
, O
and O
he O
informed O
the O
Duke O
of O
what O
had O
occurred O
. O

The O
latter O
’s O
passion O
was O
not O
so O
strong O
as O
to O
make O
him O
unable O
to O
subordinate O
it O
to O
his O
policy O
of O
retaining O
Muramasa B-PERSON
at O
the O
court O
. O

He O
judiciously O
refrained O
from O
taking O
any O
further O
steps O
to O
carry O
out O
his O
design O
, O
and O
he O
was O
too O
kind O
- O
hearted O
to O
show O
any O
displeasure O
towards O
the O
sorely O
distressed O
old O
servitor O
, O
whom O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
he O
dismissed O
with O
gentle O
words O
and O
presents O
. O

Muramasa B-PERSON
’s O
action O
in O
this O
affair O
was O
based O
upon O
opinions O
and O
convictions O
which O
with O
him O
were O
the O
result O
of O
individual O
thought O
, O
uninfluenced O
by O
surroundings O
and O
customs O
. O

His O
love O
for O
his O
daughter O
, O
like O
his O
love O
for O
his O
art O
, O
was O
a O
deep O
, O
holy O
feeling O
, O
emanating O
from O
the O
man O
’s O
inner O
nature O
. O

He O
felt O
that O
a O
life O
amid O
the O
rivalries O
and O
petty O
jealousies O
of O
the O
court O
could O
not O
afford O
her O
any O
real O
happiness O
or O
content O
; O
and O
the O
sturdy O
independence O
of O
his O
character O
prevented O
him O
from O
becoming O
imbued O
with O
those O
social O
prejudices O
which O
look O
to O
outside O
glitter O
, O
and O
to O
which O
weak O
natures O
readily O
succumb O
. O

That O
Sennoske B-PERSON
should O
have O
succeeded O
in O
ingratiating O
himself O
into O
the O
favor O
of O
such O
a O
man O
, O
who O
until O
now O
had O
kept O
everybody O
, O
high O
and O
low O
, O
at O
a O
distance O
, O
was O
something O
at O
which O
the O
good O
people O
of O
Kuwana B-GPE
marvelled O
not O
a O
little O
. O

It O
could O
only O
be O
ascribed O
to O
the O
boy O
’s O
frank O
and O
winsome O
face O
, O
to O
his O
manliness O
and O
skill O
of O
arms O
far O
in O
advance O
of O
his O
age O
, O
added O
to O
great O
reserve O
and O
modesty O
of O
demeanor O
. O

The O
court O
, O
taking O
its O
cue O
from O
the O
character O
of O
the O
Duke O
, O
had O
assumed O
a O
tone O
of O
levity O
and O
of O
boisterousness B-FAC
which O
was O
especially O
affected O
by O
the O
younger O
samurai O
, O
and O
to O
which O
Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
with O
his O
modest O
and O
retiring O
ways O
, O
was O
almost O
the O
only O
exception O
. O

It O
was O
probably O
more O
especially O
this O
latter O
quality O
which O
had O
gained O
him O
the O
regard O
of O
the O
grim O
old O
smith O
, O
who O
taught O
him O
many O
new O
points O
in O
regard O
to O
the O
use O
of O
the O
sword O
, O
and O
even O
a O
few O
general O
rules O
as O
to O
the O
making O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
. O

Two B-DATE
or I-DATE
three I-DATE
days I-DATE
seldom O
passed O
without O
seeing O
the O
lad O
at O
the O
forge O
, O
where O
he O
was O
always O
well O
received O
. O

Was O
it O
altogether O
the O
samurai O
’s O
love O
for O
the O
sword O
which O
caused O
these O
frequent O
visits O
; O
and O
were O
not O
O O
Tetsu B-ORG
’s O
bright O
eyes O
even O
a O
stronger O
attraction O
? O

It O
was O
merely O
a O
repetition O
of O
the O
old O
, O
old O
story O
. O

When O
he O
had O
first B-ORDINAL
come O
, O
she O
was O
only O
a O
child O
; O
and O
as O
she O
gradually O
budded O
into O
womanhood O
before O
his O
eyes O
, O
the O
young O
man O
, O
whose O
way O
heretofore O
, O
confined O
to O
hard O
work O
and O
study O
, O
had O
been O
serious O
and O
monotonous O
, O
did O
not O
himself O
know O
what O
it O
was O
that O
all O
at O
once O
made O
him O
look O
upon O
life O
and O
its O
surroundings O
with O
such O
bright O
, O
joyful O
, O
enthusiastic O
feelings O
. O

The O
intimacy O
growing O
up O
between O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
young O
people O
must O
have O
been O
observed O
by O
the O
smith O
; O
and O
if O
, O
even O
by O
his O
silence O
, O
he O
encouraged O
it O
, O
the O
reason O
was O
simply O
that O
the O
boy O
’s O
character O
impressed O
him O
with O
a O
sense O
of O
his O
worth O
, O
and O
he O
felt O
that O
, O
joined O
to O
Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
his O
daughter O
’s O
future O
would O
be O
in O
safe O
hands O
. O

Gradually O
his O
favoritism O
grew O
beyond O
the O
limits O
of O
mere O
passive O
indulgence O
; O
and O
Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
becoming O
almost O
like O
a O
member O
of O
the O
family O
, O
passed O
in O
the O
company O
of O
O O
Tetsu O
many O
hours O
of O
supreme O
happiness O
such O
as O
it O
is O
only O
given O
to O
true O
, O
open O
, O
and O
honest O
natures O
like O
his O
to O
enjoy O
. O

Sennoske B-PERSON
’s O
father O
knew O
nothing O
of O
this O
, O
and O
believed O
that O
his O
son O
frequented O
the O
smith B-PERSON
’s O
forge O
merely O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
the O
lessons O
he O
received O
in O
swordsmanship O
and O
forging O
, O
or O
at O
most O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
smith B-PERSON
’s O
weird O
tales O
of O
chivalrous O
daring O
, O
which O
, O
on O
returning O
home O
, O
he O
sometimes O
repeated O
. O

Before O
the O
young O
man O
was O
even O
himself O
aware O
of O
it O
, O
his O
passion O
for O
the O
girl O
was O
so O
great O
that O
he O
felt O
he O
could O
not O
live O
without O
her O
; O
and O
although O
heretofore O
he O
had O
had O
no O
secrets O
from O
his O
father O
, O
he O
experienced O
in O
this O
instance O
a O
nameless O
, O
undefined O
dread O
of O
disclosing O
his O
attachment O
. O

He O
loved O
, O
he O
fairly O
worshipped O
, O
his O
father O
; O
but O
the O
love O
was O
mixed O
with O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
reverential O
awe O
and O
deep O
pity O
, O
often O
amounting O
to O
anguish O
, O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
that O
frozen O
look O
of O
sorrow O
and O
gloom O
which O
never O
left O
Mutto B-PERSON
’s O
face O
. O

When O
not O
directly O
engaged O
in O
instructing O
his O
son O
, O
Mutto B-PERSON
’s O
only O
discourse O
had O
been O
on O
the O
obligations O
of O
a O
true O
samurai O
; O
and O
even O
here O
he O
confined O
himself O
almost O
exclusively O
to O
what O
his O
listener O
well O
knew O
was O
a O
samurai O
’s O
first B-ORDINAL
and O
chief O
duty O
— O
the B-ORG

vendetta O

Instance O
after O
instance O
did O
the O
youth O
hear O
of O
men O
who O
had O
sacrificed O
brother O
and O
sister O
, O
wife O
and O
concubine O
— O
nay O
, O
sometimes O
even O
father O
and O
mother O
— O
to O
carry O
out O
some O
just O
vengeance O
, O
and O
who O
had O
died O
happy O
because O
they O
survived O
the O
satisfactory O
end O
of O
their O
vendetta O
long O
enough O
to O
cast O
one B-CARDINAL
glance O
of O
exulting O
victory O
upon O
the O
dead O
or O
dying O
body O
of O
their O
victim O

] O

Gradually O
it O
dawned O
upon O
Sennoske B-PERSON
that O
his O
father O
, O
from O
some O
inexplicable O
cause O
, O
must O
have O
been O
unable O
to O
fulfil O
such O
a O
duty O
which O
his O
samurai O
honor O
had O
imposed O
upon O
him O
, O
and O
that O
he O
was O
educating O
his O
son O
to O
act O
in O
his O
stead O
. O

The O
thought O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
struck O
the O
lad O
, O
brought O
a O
thrill O
of O
wild O
and O
fierce O
delight O
. O

With O
conscious O
pride O
he O
felt O
that O
his O
body O
, O
trained O
to O
every O
athletic O
exercise O
, O
his O
sinews O
of O
steel O
and O
muscles O
of O
iron O
, O
his O
quick O
eye O
and O
swift O
foot O
, O
gave O
him O
a O
better O
right O
than O
any O
other O
youth O
of O
his O
age O
to O
hope O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
dream O
of O
every O
young O
samurai O
— O
to O
see O
himself O
grasping O
his O
blood O
- O
stained O
sword O
and O
covered O
with O
mortal O
wounds O
, O
his O
foot O
upon O
the O
body O
of O
his O
prostrate O
and O
dying O
foe O
. O

No O
samurai O
worthy O
of O
the O
name O
had O
a O
higher O
ambition O
than O
to O
die O
such O
a O
death O
; O
and O
when O
Sennoske B-PERSON
lived O
, O
the O
spirit O
that O
ruled O
men O
of O
his O
class O
was O
not O
different O
from O
what O
it O
had O
been O
for O
centuries B-DATE
before O
, O
or O
from O
what O
it O
continued O
to O
be O
up O
to O
within O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
decades I-DATE
. O

The O
thoughts O
, O
hopes O
, O
and O
expectations O
thus O
engendered O
in O
the O
mind O
of O
Sennoske B-PERSON
had O
completely O
occupied O
it O
until O
he O
met O
O O
Tetsu O
. O

Not O
that O
this O
event O
wrought O
anything O
like O
a O
complete O
revulsion O
of O
feeling O
. O

No O
new O
- O
born O
passion O
could O
wholly O
supersede O
the O
result O
of O
traditional O
and O
inherited O
tendencies O
, O
and O
of O
an O
education O
which O
had O
caused O
the O
tenets O
of O
a O
soldier O
’s O
creed O
to O
be O
instilled O
with O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
glimmer O
of O
consciousness O
. O

Sennoske B-PERSON
was O
still O
as O
ready O
as O
ever O
to O
dare O
anything O
and O
sacrifice O
everything O
in O
the O
cause O
of O
his O
father O
’s O
vendetta O
. O

With O
that O
object O
in O
view O
he O
would O
not O
have O
hesitated O
a O
moment O
to O
lay O
down O
his O
life O
if O
necessary O
. O

But O
this O
“ O
if O
necessary O
” O
had O
now O
intruded O
itself O
where O
before O
no O
thought O
had O
been O
given O
to O
it O
. O

He O
sometimes O
feared O
that O
he O
was O
even O
lacking O
in O
loyalty O
and O
good O
faith O
to O
the O
principle O
in O
which O
he O
had O
been O
brought O
up O
, O
because O
he O
permitted O
himself O
to O
look O
forward O
to O
any O
end O
but O
one O
; O
and O
this O
was O
doubtless O
the O
reason O
why O
he O
refrained O
from O
speaking O
to O
his O
father O
of O
his O
passion O
for O
O O
Tetsu O
. O

Day O
by O
day O
, O
however O
, O
that O
passion O
grew O
; O
until O
he O
felt O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
cease O
hoping O
that O
he O
might O
yet O
call O
the O
girl O
his O
own O
, O
and O
that O
the O
fulfilment O
of O
his O
mission O
, O
whatever O
duties O
it O
entailed O
, O
might O
not O
be O
irreconcilable O
with O
the O
consummation O
of O
his O
desires O
. O

CHAPTER O
VI O
. O

Ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
had O
elapsed O
since O
Mutto B-PERSON
and O
his O
son O
had O
first B-ORDINAL
come O
to O
Kuwana B-GPE
, O
and O
the O
great O
struggle O
so O
long O
impending O
was O
now O
fairly O
breaking O
out O
. O

That O
the O
crisis O
had O
not O
occurred O
sooner O
was O
a O
matter O
of O
sufficient O
wonder O
, O
and O
was O
owing O
altogether O
to O
the O
strong O
measures O
of O
repression O
, O
to O
the O
undoubted O
ability O
for O
governing O
possessed O
in O
general O
by O
those O
who O
were O
still O
the O
actual O
rulers O
of O
the O
land O
. O

But O
although O
the O
overthrow O
of O
the O
Hōjō B-PERSON
might O
be O
delayed O
, O
it O
could O
not O
be O
averted O
. O

The O
insolent O
pride O
of O
these O
chieftains O
, O
not O
content O
with O
setting O
up O
and O
pulling O
down O
Shôguns O
at O
will O
, O
and O
punishing O
with O
death O
all O
who O
incurred O
their O
displeasure O
, O
had O
even O
heaped O
indignities O
upon O
the O
imperial O
family O
; O
and O
from O

The O

had O
de O

always O
been O
wielded O
by O
some O
chieftain O
whose O
genius O

naturally O
in O
those O
times O
mainly O
of O
a O
military O
character O

had O
enabled O
him O
to O
arrogate O

If O
at O

the O

often O

this O
power O

In O

All O

both O

he O
firmly O

made O
himself O

thus O

showed O
harshness O
only O
in O
what O
might O

thought O

reconcile O

the O
disrespect O
shown O

The O

the O

must O
sooner O

take O
vengeance O
not O
only O
upon O

also O
upon O
the O
people O

Although O
hardly O
probable O

it O
is O
yet O
perhaps O
barely O
possible O
, O
that O
the O
Hōjōs B-ORG
harbored O
the O
thought O
of O
being O
able O
some B-DATE

and O
it O
may O
have O
been O
this O
hope O
which O
dictated O

policy O

They O
could O
not O

know O
that O
such O
a O
consummation O
might O
be O
looked O
for O
only O
after O
long O
years O

they O
therefore O
tried O
to O
lessen O
the O
imperial O

by O
forcing O
successive O
Mikados B-ORG

abdicate O

making O
light O

But O
if O
some O
such O
deep O

laid O
scheme O
really O
animated O
their O
course O

events O
proved O
that O
they O

miscalculated O
the O

called O
upon O
the O
whole O

to O
assist O
him O

This O
new O
champion O
of O
the O
Mikado B-PRODUCT

lord O

he O
as O

as O
his O

lord O
of O

castle O
of O
Ashikaga B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
joined O
him O
in O
the O

were O
direct O
descendants O
of O
a O
celebrated O
Minamoto B-ORG
chief O

their O
fiefs O

which O
lay O
in O
contiguous O
provinces O
, O
within O
easy O
distance O
of O
the O
Hōjō B-PERSON
stronghold O
Kamakura B-GPE
, O
having O
been O
in O
uninterrupted O
possession O
of O
themselves O
and O
their O
forefathers O
for O
nearly B-DATE
four I-DATE
hundred I-DATE
years I-DATE

Nitta B-ORG
had O
earned O
a O
high O
military O
reputation O
while O
serving O
as O
captain O
in O
the O
Hōjō B-PERSON
armies O
. O

He O
had O
been O
deputed O
with O
a O
large O
force O
to O
subdue O
Kusunoki B-PERSON
Masashige I-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
thrice O
within O
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
raised O
the O
flag O
of O
revolt O
, O
and O
although O
defeated O
each O
time O
, O
had O
still O
managed O
to O
escape O
to O
unfurl O
anew O
the O
imperial O
standard O
and O
assemble O
soldiers O
in O
its O
defence O
. O

Although O
Nitta B-ORG
had O
always O
been O
ready O
to O
support O
the O
Hōjō B-ORG
chiefs O
against O
rivals O
, O
or O
even O
in O
schemes O
of O
personal O
aggrandizement O
, O
he O
yet O
had O
no O
wish O
to O
fight O
against O
the O
supporters O
of O
the O
Mikado B-PRODUCT
. O

He O
dared O
not O
refuse O
the O
command O
offered O
to O
him O
, O
as O
he O
would O
thus O
lay O
himself O
open O
to O
suspicion O
, O
and O
suspicion O
then O
meant O
death O

His O
resolution O
in O
this O
dilemma O
was O
soon O
made O
. O

Having O
started O
with O
his O
troops O
, O
he O
carefully O
sounded O
the O
temper O
of O
the O
officers O

men O
; O
and O
finding O
it O
what O
he O
expected O

exhibited O
a O
commission O

he O
had O
procured O
from O
the O
exiled O

at O
the O

time O
describing O

the O
condition O
of O

They O
one O

all O
agreed O

they O
had O
been O
sent O

All O
previous O

been O
confined O

the O
lack O

with O
the O

had O

in O
their O
easy O

Nitta B-ORG
was O
resolved O
to O
carry O
the O
war O
into O
the O
enemy O

where O
he O
knew O

would O
muster O

as O
soon O
as O
a O
favorable O
opportunity O
should O
present O
itself O
; O
but O
for O
a O
time O
he O
pitched O
his O
camp O
at O
his O
own O
castle O

Before O
setting O
out O
, O
however O
, O
he O
sent O
proclamations O
to O
the O

stating O
his O

restoring O

When O

heard O
of O
Nitta B-ORG

rising O

the O
manifesto O

he O
hesitated O
not O
a O
moment O

immediately O
proclaimed O
himself O
one O
of O
those O
who O
were O
determined O
to O
secure O
to O

rights O

On O
account O
of O
his O
bodily O
infirmities O
, O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
take O
an O
active O
part O
himself O
; O
but O
couriers O
were O
immediately O
despatched O
assuring O
Nitta B-ORG
of O
his O
support O

and O
promising O
that O
two B-CARDINAL

should O
leave O
Kuwana B-GPE

four B-DATE

was O
as O
good O
as O
his O

within O
the O
specified O

as O
fine O
a O
body O

any O

the O

well O
equipped O

provided O
with O
all O

against O
the O
Hōjō B-PERSON

Sennoske B-PERSON
naturally O

, O
contrary O

of O
having O
him O
by O
his O
side O
in O
case O
of O
any O
local O
disturbance O
which O
Hōjō B-PERSON
partisans O
might O
raise O
. O

While O
making O
his O
hurried O
preparations O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
Sennoske B-PERSON
that O
his O
father O
was O
several O
times O
on O
the O
point O
of O
telling O
him O
what O
he O
felt O
must O
be O
the O
secret O
of O
his O
life O
; O
but O
each O
time O
Mutto B-PERSON
checked O
himself O
, O
changing O
the O
conversation O
to O
other O
subjects O
, O
and O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
day I-DATE
of O
Sennoske B-PERSON
’s O
stay O
had O
nearly O
passed O
away O
without O
his O
having O
learned O
anything O
in O
regard O
to O
it O
. O

He O
had O
not O
yet O
found O
time O
in O
the O
hurry O
of O
preparation O
to O
take O
leave O
of O
Muramasa B-PERSON
and O
O O
Tetsu O
. O

Going O
to O
Senjuin B-PERSON
late B-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O
when O
all O
his O
arrangements O
for O
departure O
had O
been O
completed O
, O
he O
found O
the O
girl O
at O
the O
open O
door O
of O
the O
forge O
awaiting O
his O
arrival O
, O
the O
smith O
and O
his O
son O
being O
within O
, O
busily O
engaged O
in O
work O
. O

The O
young O
man O
followed O
his O
future O
little O
wife O
, O
as O
he O
already O
sometimes O
playfully O
called O
her O
, O
to O
a O
room O
above O
; O
and O
there O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
exchanged O
those O
vows O
and O
professions O
of O
love O
and O
promises O
of O
eternal O
faithfulness O
which O
, O
in O
Japan B-GPE
as O
well O
as O
everywhere O
else O
, O
have O
been O
repeated O
millions B-CARDINAL
of O
times O
before O
, O
and O
will O
be O
repeated O
millions B-CARDINAL
of O
times O
again O
. O

Then O
their O
talk O
ran O
on O
, O
and O
became O
principally O
a O
reiteration O
of O
the O
hope O
of O
meeting O
each O
other O
again O
, O
with O
flattering O
prognostications O
on O
the O
part O
of O
O O
Tetsu O
as O
to O
the O
distinctions O
which O
her O
lover O
was O
sure O
to O
gain O
in O
battle O
; O
and O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
latter O
’s O
deprecating O
remonstrance O
, O
it O
was O
evident O
by O
his O
pleased O
looks O
that O
he O
listened O
not O
unwillingly O
. O

His O
was O
a O
handsome O
face O
, O
and O
the O
flush O
of O
enthusiasm O
and O
of O
sanguine O
youthful O
ambition O
which O
now O
sat O
upon O
it O
enhanced O
its O
natural O
beauty O
. O

So O
engrossed O
were O
the O
lovers O
in O
each O
other O
that O
they O
took O
no O
note O
of O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
sliding O
door O
of O
the O
room O
, O
and O
both O
started O
upon O
hearing O
the O
voice O
of O
O O
Tetsu O
’s O
father O
, O
whom O
they O
now O
saw O
standing O
close O
beside O
them O
, O
holding O
in O
his O
hand O
a O
sword O
splendidly O
mounted O
in O
gold O
, O
and O
wrapped O
in O
rich O
silk O
. O

There O
was O
a O
kindly O
look O
on O
his O
face O
such O
as O
even O
his O
daughter O
had O
rarely O
seen O
there O
before O
; O
and O
when O
he O
asked O
her O
to O
leave O
them O
alone O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
moments I-TIME
, O
his O
naturally O
harsh O
and O
firm O
voice O
was O
modulated O
in O
a O
soft O
and O
tender O
tone O
. O

His O
rugged O
, O
athletic O
frame O
evidently O
shook O
with O
strong O
emotion O
; O
but O
Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
often O
seen O
him O
when O
laboring O
under O
strong O
excitement O
, O
knew O
that O
this O
time O
the O
moving O
cause O
was O
neither O
anger O
nor O
hate O
. O

“ O
Take O
this O
sword O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
Sennoske B-PERSON
the O
while O
becoming O
almost O
delirious O
with O
joy O
; O
“ O
a O
better O
one O
I O
never O
forged O
in O
my O
life O
. O
” O

Then O
, O
after O
a O
moment O
’s O
pause O
, O
he O
added O
: O
“ O
I O
have O
learned O
to O
feel O
more O
affection O
for O
you O
, O
Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
than O
I O
thought O
I O
could O
ever O
feel O
for O
any O
one O
outside O
of O
my O
own O
family O
, O
partly O
probably O
because O
I O
trust O
that O
with O
you O
my O
daughter O
will O
be O
happy O
; O
but O
I O
also O
love O
you O
for O
your O
own O
sake O
, O
and O
because O
your O
youthful O
ambition O
reminds O
me O
of O
a O
time O
when O
I O
was O
like O
you O
. O

I O
hope O
and O
trust O
that O
your O
fate O
points O
to O
a O
happier O
lot O
than O
mine O
has O
been O
. O

I O
am O
of O
humble O
birth O
; O
and O
this O
, O
with O
the O
peace O
reigning O
over O
the O
land O
, O
has O
proved O
an O
impassable O
barrier O
to O
my O
achieving O
distinction O
in O
arms O
and O
carving O
out O
a O
name O
for O
myself O
that O
might O
, O
as O
I O
once O
dreamed O
, O
stand O
worthily O
by O
the O
side O
of O
Japan B-GPE
’s O
great O
heroes O
. O

“ O
Oh O
! O
the O
misery O
of O
feeling O
that O
one O
possesses O
the O
strength O
of O
arm O
and O
the O
resolute O
will O
to O
achieve O
great O
things O
, O
and O
yet O
to O
lack O

I O
was O

from O
early B-TIME

at I-TIME

while O
my O
food O
was O
of O
the O

but O
I O
would O
have O
worked O
ten B-CARDINAL

been O

I O
could O

one I-CARDINAL

to O
become O
a O

It O
was O
not O

to O

I O
had O
no O

no O

is O
the O

Many O

what O

numberless O

I O
succeeded O

He O

I O
gave O
her O

For O
seven B-DATE

did O
I O
dissemble O

performing O
the O

prove O
my O

before O
my O

My O

“ O
The O

Oh O

the O
fools O

they O
think O
that O

it O

cold O

motionless O

without O
apparent O
life O

Thrice O

they O
kill O
the O

and O
yet O
they O
know O
from O
their O

have O
learned O
to O
prattle O

that O
the O
sword O
is O
the O
living O
soul O
of O
the O
samurai O

“ O
There O
is O
life O

this O

I O

But O
remember O
that O
on O
this O
account O
, O
unless O
you O
use O
it O
wisely O

carefully O

this O
sword O
is O
a O
dangerous O
gift O

Never O
draw O
it O
unless O
you O
need O
its O
help O
; O
never O
return O
it O
to O
its O
scabbard O
without O
using O
it O
; O

never O
let O
it O
remain O
undrawn O

a O

twelve B-DATE

you O

the O
stars O
without O
being O
able O

use O
it O
on O
the O
enemy O

provoked O
you O

then O
before O
returning O
it O
to O
its O
scabbard O
use O
it O
on O
some O
inferior O
animal O

but O
never O
think O

sheathing O
it O
without O
the O

having O
come O
in O

the O
blood O
of O
something O
still O

If O
you O
act O
thus O

you O
will O
find O
it O
your O

it O
will O
obey O

even O
anticipate O
your O
thoughts O

with O
the O

it O

But O
if O
you O
fail O

obeying O
the O
directions O

you O

the O
blade O

turn O

even O
were O
you O

would O
not O
fail O

” O

The O
mainspring O
which O
moved O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
smith O
was O
evident O
. O

Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
although O
he O
was O
young O
and O
inexperienced O
in O
the O
passions O
which O
stir O
the O
heart O
and O
guide O
the O
actions O
of O
men O
, O
was O
yet O
a O
keen O
observer O
, O
and O
he O
could O
now O
easily O
fathom O
the O
depths O
of O
the O
sword O
- O
smith O
’s O
strange O
nature O
. O

He O
saw O
that O
the O
man O
’s O
ruling O
passion O
was O
ambition O
— O
ambition O
so O
inordinate O
that O
it O
could O
never O
be O
satisfied O
, O
and O
which O
, O
burning O
so O
fiercely O
without O
hope O
of O
realization O
, O
had O
retired O
into O
itself O
and O
assumed O
the O
semblance O
of O
a O
morose O
and O
misanthropic O
disposition O
. O

The O
mildness O
apparent O
in O
him O
when O
he O
entered O
the O
room O
had O
passed O
away O
after O
a O
few O
moments O
; O
and O
as O
he O
recounted O
his O
sufferings O
and O
disappointments O
, O
the O
play O
of O
his O
features O
and O
the O
tones O
of O
his O
speech O
had O
been O
a O
fitting O
accompaniment O
to O
the O
words O
he O
uttered O
. O

Yet O
his O
voice O
had O
never O
been O
loud O
, O
and O
while O
allowing O
scope O
to O
his O
passions O
he O
still O
evidently O
held O
them O
in O
check O
. O

Nevertheless O
the O
eyes O
which O
shone O
like O
coals O
of O
fire O
, O
and O
the O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
hissing O
sound O
of O
his O
utterance O
showed O
plainly O
how O
deeply O
he O
was O
moved O
by O
dwelling O
upon O
his O
real O
and O
fancied O
wrongs O
. O

Sennoske B-PERSON
had O
often O
seen O
fierce O
outbreaks O
of O
temper O
; O
yet O
as O
he O
now O
listened O
he O
gave O
an O
involuntary O
start O
, O
due O
not O
so O
much O
to O
what O
was O
presented O
to O
his O
senses O
as O
to O
the O
thought O
of O
how O
fierce O
a O
volcano O
must O
have O
been O
burning O
for O
years B-DATE
in O
that O
herculean O
frame O

Slight O
as O
the O
movement O
was O
, O
it O
did O
not O
escape O
the O
smith O
; O
it O
arrested O
immediately O
the O
force O
of O
the O
current O
into O
which O
he O
had O
drifted O
with O
the O
recital O
of O
these O
reminiscences O
, O
and O
as O
he O
continued O
he O
resumed O
the O
quiet O
earnestness O
which O
he O
had O
shown O
upon O
first B-ORDINAL
entering O
. O

“ O
I O
have O
long O
looked O
forward O
to O
the O
breaking O
out O
of O

I O
thought O
at O
one B-CARDINAL
time O
that O
my O
son O
would O
realize O
my O
hopes O
of O
a O
glorious O
career O
in O

although O
physically O
strong O

not O

, O
however O

I O
firmly O
believe O

will O
make O
a O

When O
you O
return O
from O
this O
campaign O
the O
hand O

O O
Tetsu O

be O
yours O

the O

indeed O

coupled O

not O
only O
with O
the O
skill O

also O
with O
the O
memory O

heroic O
deeds O

This O
sword O

I O
give O
you O

part O

the O
dowry O

future O

I O

now O
leave O
you O

unacquainted O

your O

the O

The O
parting O
of O
the O
lovers O
was O
of O
necessity O
brief O
, O
as O
it O
was O
time O
for O
Sennoske B-PERSON
to O
return O
; O
but O
deep O
love O
and O
passionate O
devotion O
spoke O
on O
both O
sides O

O O
Tetsu O
was O
overjoyed O
at O
hearing O
that O
her O
father O
had O
openly O
countenanced O
their O
mutual O
affection O

As O
the O
young O
man O
passed O
through O
the O
forge O
on O
his O
way O
home O

he O
again O
wished O
to O
thank O
the O

his O
princely O
gift O

had O
relapsed O
into O
his O
usual O
taciturn O
mood O
, O
stopped O
him O
short O
, O
telling O
him O
that O
his O
father O
had O
a O
right O
to O
whatever O
time O
was O
still O
at O
his O
disposal O
. O

With O
a O
few O
words O
of O
farewell O
to O
the O
smith O
and O
his O
son O
, O
and O
a O
last O
look O
at O
O O
Tetsu B-ORG
’s O
window O
, O
he O
tore O
himself O
away O
. O

When O
he O
reached O
home O
he O
found O
his O
father O
sitting O
beside O
the O
brazier O
, O
with O
letters O
and O
papers O
spread O
out O
before O
him O
. O

At O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
magnificent O
sword O
, O
Mutto B-PERSON
showed O
even O
more O
emotion O
than O
his O
son O
had O
expected O
under O
the O
circumstances O
. O

He O
looked O
at O
it O
on O
all O
sides O
, O
weighed O
it O
in O
his O
hands O
, O
and O
partly O
withdrew O
the O
blade O
, O
slowly O
, O
inch O
by O
inch O
, O
replacing O
it O
only O
to O
withdraw O
it O
similarly O
over O
and O
over O
again O
. O

While O
this O
was O
going O
on O
, O
Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
not O
without O
a O
sinking O
heart O
, O
acquainted O
him O
with O
what O
had O
happened O
regarding O
O O
Tetsu O
; O
but O
, O
contrary O
to O
his O
fears O
and O
expectations O
, O
the O
recital O
elicited O
no O
displeasure O
and O
hardly O
any O
surprise O
. O

“ O
Many O
a O
man O
superior O
to O
you O
in O
worldly O
position O
would O
willingly O
and O
gladly O
marry O
an O
Eta B-ORG
if O
she O
brought O
him O
such O
a O
dowry O
, O
” O
was O
the O
response O
; O
“ O
and O
even O
without O
this O
princely O
gift O
I O
could O
have O
raised O
no O
objection O
to O
your O
marriage O
with O
one O
who O
is O
in O
other O
respects O
your O
equal O
. O

But O
, O
my O
boy O
, O
” O
Mutto B-PERSON
continued O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
which O
showed O
that O
he O
was O
powerfully O
affected O
, O
“ O
you O
run O
a O
risk O
beyond O
that O
of O
any O
of O
your O
companions O
. O

With O
your O
strength O
, O
your O
skill O
in O
arms O
, O
and O
your O
discriminating O
wisdom O
, O
I O
have O
no O
fears O
for O
you O
as O
to O
the O
ordinary O
chances O
of O
battle O
. O

If O
you O
fall O
, O
it O
will O
be O
as O
a O
hero O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
with O
all O
these O
advantages O
, O
added O
to O
the O
sword O
you O
carry O
, O
you O
will O
be O
sure O
to O
achieve O
distinction O
. O

“ O
There O
is O
, O
however O
, O
a O
task O
which O
devolves O
upon O
you O
where O
no O
public O
honor O
is O
to O
be O
gained O
, O
and O
where O
the O
danger O
is O
infinitely O
greater O

nay O
, O
where O
it O
is O
extremely O
doubtful O
whether O
you O
will O
survive O
success O
, O
or O
even O
the O
mere O
attempt O
to O
achieve O
it O

I O
have O
refrained O
from O
speaking O
to O
you O
about O
this O
heretofore O
, O
and O
my O
intention O
was O
to O
give O
you O
all O
the O
particulars O
to O
- O

But O
upon O
mature O
consideration O
I O
have O
determined O
again O
to O
defer O
it O

Old O
Yamagawa B-PERSON

who O
accompanies O
you O

knows O
the O

has O
my O
orders O
to O
disclose O
it O
to O
you O
when O
the O

I O
know O
you O
will O
not O

a O

do O

everything O

accomplish O
the O
object O

have O
in O

act O
with O
prudence O

circumspection O

do O
not O

My O
future O
without O

be O
dreary O

although O

to O
sacrifice O
your O

the O
pursuit O
of O
a O
just O
vengeance O

yet O
to O
see O
that O
vengeance O
accomplished O

be O
happiness O
indeed O

You O
have O
yet O
to O
take O
leave O
of O
the O
Duke B-ORG

and O
you O
will O
naturally O
desire O
to O
show O
your O
sword O
at O
court O

Do O
not O
be O
chary O
of O
doing O
so O
; O
it O
will O
be O
of O
great O
benefit O
to O
you O

You O
will O
start O
with O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

we O
will O
spare O

Sennoske B-PERSON
was O
deeply O
touched O
; O
yet O
, O
with O
the O
varied O
emotions O
which O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
had O
brought O
forth O
, O
the O
pain O
of O
separation O
was O
less O
acute O
than O
under O

. O

At O
the O
castle O
the O
preparations O
for O
the O
departure O

so O
many O
men O

caused O
an O
unusual O
stir O

with O

When O
, O
after O

himself O
announced O

Sennoske B-PERSON
entered O
the O
large O
audience O

filled O
with O

with O
those O

were O
bound O

come O

their O
homage O

Passing O
through O
the O

the O

with O

after O
addressing O
him O
in O
his O
usual O

at O
once O
fixed O
his O
attention O
upon O
the O

which O
in O

looked O
sufficiently O
conspicuous O

“ O
What O

he O
exclaimed O

“ O
you O

are O
such O
a O
sober O

rough O
life O
in O

about O

all O

this O

carried O
it O
in O
unvarnished O
plain O

scabbards O

Is O
it O
your O
old O
sword O
, O
or O
have O
you O
also O
exchanged O
it O
for O
some O
modern O
weapon O
which O
glitters O

shines O
to O
match O
the O
outside O

but O
which O
will O
break O
as O
soon O
as O
your O

causes O
it O

fall O
upon O
helmet O

cuirass O

“ O

is O
a O

the O

himself O

me O
less B-TIME

if O
it O

only O
as O
true O

it O

While O
speaking O
, O
Sennoske B-PERSON
offered O
the O
sword O
for O
inspection O
to O
the O
Duke B-ORG
, O
whose O
astonishment O

shared O
by O
every O

was O
so O
great O
that O

could O
not O

it O

with O
the O
weapon O

for O
several O
moments O

sufficiently O
to O

Looking O
at O
it O
in O
the O
orthodox O
fashion O
, O
by O
withdrawing O
it O
slowly O

carefully O
, O
inch O

inch O

until O
about B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
of O
it O
was O
exposed O
, O
Ono B-PERSON
ga I-PERSON
Sawa I-PERSON

astonishment O
gave O
way O
to O
admiration O

and O
so O
absorbed O
did O
he O
become O
in O
his O
gaze O
, O
that O
notwithstanding O
those O
present O
in O
the O
hall O
, O
whose O
surprise O
had O
been O
as O
great O
as O
that O
of O
their O
chief O
, O
pressed O
around O
him O
closer O
than O
court O
etiquette O
ordinarily O
permitted O
, O
he O
seemed O
utterly O
oblivious O
of O
their O
curiosity O

A O
long O
time O
elapsed O
before O
he O
even O
looked O
up O
, O
and O
then O
those O
around O
, O
recollecting O
themselves O
, O
hastily O
drew O
back O
; O
but O
his O
thoughts O
were O
as O
yet O
too O
much O
occupied O
with O
the O
sword O
to O
notice O
any O
impropriety O

“ O
To O
a O

value O

” O
the O

at O
last O
; O
“ O
and O
to O
tell O
you O
to O
be O
careful O
of O
such O
a O
treasure O
would O
be O
like O
asking O
the O
heavens O
to O
guard O
the O
sun O
, O
like O
telling O
a O
child O
to O
cherish O
its O
parents O

like O
importuning O

not O

we O

but O
should O
it O
happen O
that O
any O
single O
action O
in O
which O

against O

I O
charge O
all O

see O
that O

that O
even O
if O

it O

brought O
back O
here O

returned O
to O
your O
father O

It O
will O
be O
the O
thought O
of O
many O
that O
Muramasa B-PERSON
has O
distinguished O
you O
in O
a O
way O
which O
your O
years B-DATE
hardly O
justify O
; O
but O
he O
has O
only O
given O
expression O
to O
opinions O
which O
I O
also O
hold O
as O
to O
your O
merit O

I O
hope O
and O
believe O
you O
will O
return O
safely O

with O
honor O

my O
good O

you O
have O
them O
in O
the O

Meanwhile O
the O
news O
had O
been O
spread O
in O
the O
courtyard O
by O
some O
of O
the O
servants O
, O
who O
had O
heard O
it O
in O
the O
hall O
; O
and O
when O
Sennoske B-PERSON
retired O
, O
he O
found O
himself O
surrounded O
by O
an O
eager O
crowd O
anxious O
to O
examine O
his O
gift O
and O
to O
congratulate O
him O
upon O
his O
good O
fortune O
. O

Most O
of O
them O
doubtless O
were O
sincere O
; O
for O
he O
had O
always O
been O
a O
great O
favorite O
, O
and O
there O
was O
little O
to O
excite O
envy O
in O
the O
modest O
manner O
with O
which O
he O
had O
invariably O
borne O
himself O
. O

He O
was O
detained O
for O
a O
considerable O
time O
, O
and O
it O
was O
nearly B-TIME
midnight I-TIME
before O
he O
reached O
his O
home O
, O
where O
Yamagawa B-ORG
waited O
for O
him O
. O

Everything O
was O
ready O
for O
departure O
; O
and O
as O
he O
threw O
himself O
upon O
the O
quilted O
mats O
of O
his O
bed O
for O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours I-TIME
’ O
repose O
, O
the O
events O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
flitted O
before O
him O
, O
mingled O
with O
hopes O
dictated O
by O
ambition O
, O
with O
a O
vague O
dread O
as O
to O
his O
father O
’s O
objects O
and O
purposes O
, O
and O
of O
course O
with O
tender O
thoughts O
of O
O O
Tetsu O

But O
even O
these O
did O
not O
prevent O
him O
from O
soon O
falling O
into O
a O
deep O
sleep O

which O
the O
exertion O

the O
excitement O

the O
varied O
incidents O
of O
such O
an O
eventful O
day O
naturally O
induced O
in O
a O
healthy O

robust O
body O
; O
still O
they O
were O
powerful O
enough O
to O
retain O
their O
influence O
over O
his O
mind O
after O
consciousness O
had O
left O
it O

They O
conjured O
up O
picture O

of O
happiness O

and O
when O

awoke O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME

afterward O
, O
O O
Tetsu B-ORG

image O
was O
still O
in O
his O
thoughts O

her O
name O
on O

lips O

Rousing O
himself O
, O
his O
eye O
fell O
upon O
the O
sword O
by O
his O
side O
, O
and O
then O
only O
did O
the O
reality O
come O
home O
to O
him O
; O
with O
a O
half B-CARDINAL
sigh O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
exulting O
glance O
which O
he O
bestowed O
upon O

he O
was O
soon O
dressed O
and O
ready O
for O
departure O

He O
could O
hear O
his O
father O
moving O
about O
in O
the O
next O
room O
, O
which O
was O
separated O
from O
his O
only O
by O
a O
paper O

the B-DATE

no O

see O
him O
again O

As O
he O
went O
to O
join O
his O
party O
, O
it O
gave O
him O
a O
pang O
to O
recollect O
how O
much O
more O
his O
mind O
had O
been O
occupied O
with O
thoughts O
of O
the O

been O
parent O

everything O
to O
him O
; O

he O
muttered O
a O
fervent O
prayer O
that O
it O
might O
be O
granted O
him O
to O
try O
his O
strength O
with O
his O
father O

CHAPTER O
VIII O
. O

The O
war O
in O
which O
Sennoske B-PERSON
now O
took O
part O
forms O
one O
of O
the O
most O
glorious O
epochs O
in O
Japanese B-NORP
history O
. O

On O
one B-CARDINAL
side O
was O
the O
imperial O
family O
, O
who O
in O
an O
unbroken O
line O
had O
ruled O
the O
land O
for O
two B-DATE
thousand I-DATE
years I-DATE
; O
and O
yet O
this O
period O
represented O
but O
a O
small O
part O
of O
the O
time O
during O
which O
their O
authority O
had O
been O
recognized O
, O
for O
they O
were O
directly O
descended O
from O
the O
gods O
who O
had O
been O
venerated O
and O
adored O
from O
time O
immemorial O
. O

Opposed O
to O
the O
imperial O
cause O
was O
a O
horde O
of O
usurpers O
, O
whose O
only O
claim O
to O
recognition O
was O
the O
power O
which O
they O
wielded O
temporarily O
, O
and O
, O
as O
they O
themselves O
knew O
, O
unjustly O
. O

It O
was O
a O
struggle O
of O
the O
inherited O
and O
invested O
majesty O
of O
right O
, O
religion O
, O
patriotism O
, O
and O
justice O
, O
against O
usurpation O
, O
cunning O
, O
and O
intrigue O
; O
and O
the O
result O
could O
not O
be O
in O
doubt O
. O

Yet O
it O
is O
a O
subject O
of O
just O
pride O
to O

imperial O
family O

to O
the O
people O
whom O
they O
govern O
that O
victory O
was O
achieved O
in O
so O
short O
a O
time O

a B-DATE

months I-DATE
being O
sufficient O
for O
the O
complete O
overthrow O
of O
the O
hitherto O
all O
- O
powerful O
usurpers O
. O

The O
latter O
and O
their O
adherents O
fought O
bravely O
, O
and O
their O
natural O
courage O
was O
doubtless O
stimulated O
to O
its O
utmost O
by O
the O
knowledge O
that O
defeat O
with O
them O
meant O
utter O
annihilation O
, O
accompanied O
with O
eternal O
shame O
and O
disgrace O
. O

Yet O
their O
desperate O
valor O
availed O
them O
nothing O
. O

They O
fought O
like O
burglars O
caught O
in O
the O
act O
; O
but O
the O
cool O
, O
steady O
, O
and O
determined O
loyalty O
of O
the O
imperial O
partisans O
mowed O
them O
down O
as O
the O
sharp O
knife O
of O
the O
husbandman O
cuts O
down O
noxious O
weeds O
. O

Although O
the O
Kuwana B-NORP
contingent O
was O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
to O
join O
the O
forces O
of O
the O
popular O
general O
, O
Nitta B-ORG
, O
they O
found O
him O
already O
greatly O
strengthened O
by O
numerous O
volunteers O
and O
deserters O
. O

Several O
encounters O
which O
soon O
took O
place O
with O
detachments O
of O
Hōjō B-PERSON
forces O
sent O
against O
them O
resulted O
in O
an O
easy O
victory O
, O
as O
large O
numbers O
of O
the O
vanquished O
troops O
deserted O
their O
colors O
and O
enlisted O
for O
the O
righteous O
cause O
. O

In O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
these O
engagements O
, O
Nitta B-ORG
, O
who O
always O
fought O
in O
the O
van O
of O
his O
troops O
, O
noticed O
near O
him O
a O
knight O
whose O
alertness O
and O
elasticity O
of O
movement O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
his O
complete O
coat O
of O
mail O
, O
could O
belong O
only O
to O
a O
young O
man O
, O
while O
the O
blows O
which O
he O
dealt O
were O
such O
as O
few O
even O
among O
veterans O
could O
give O
— O
his O
sword O
at O
every O
stroke O
cleaving O
a O
Hōjō B-PERSON
armor O
and O
going O
deep O
into O
the O
body O
beneath O
it O
. O

It O
was O
no O
other O
than O
Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
whom O
, O
immediately O
after O
the O
fray O
and O
on O
the O
field O
of O
battle O
, O
Nitta B-ORG
made O
one O
of O
his O
aids O
. O

Others O
besides O
the O
general O
had O
noticed O
the O
prowess O
of O
the O
new O
- O
comer O
, O
and O
admiration O
changed O
to O
wonder O
when O
he O
took O
off O
his O
helmet O
and O
showed O
his O
fair O
, O
boyish O
face O
, O
as O
yet O
with O
scarcely O
a O
vestige O
of O
beard O
, O
and O
with O
a O
complexion O
that O
a O
girl O
might O
have O
envied O
. O

Within O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
the O
army O
in O
and O
around O
the O
castle O
had O
, O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
its O
leader O
, O
become O
strong O
enough O
to O
try O
issues O
with O
the O
enemy O
in O
the O
latter O
’s O
stronghold O
. O

Marching O
orders O
were O
therefore O
given O
, O
and O
the O
troops O
were O
told O
openly O
that O
their O
destination O
was O
Kamakura B-GPE
, O
which O
was O
to O
be O
taken O
by O
storm O
. O

Meeting O
no O
opposition O
worthy O
of O
the O
name O
, O
they O
reached O
the O
sea O
- O
shore O
at O
Enoshima B-GPE
, O
only B-QUANTITY
three I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
from O
their O
destination O
. O

Here O
an O
unexpected O
difficulty O
presented O
itself O
. O

Although O
it O
was O
ebb O
- O
tide O
the O
sea O
ran O
extremely O
high O
, O
so O
that O
the O
road O
along O
the O
shore O
was O
submerged O
beneath O
angry O
waves O
, O
which O
washed O
even O
the O
steep O
mountain O
spurs O
from O
whose O
base O
they O
were O
generally O
separated O
by O
several B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
of O
hard O
, O
sandy O
soil O
. O

The O
only O
way O
to O
reach O
Kamakura B-GPE
seemed O
to O
be O
for O
them O
to O
retrace O
their O
steps O
by O
a O
long O
détour O
round O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
mountain O
. O

This O
course O
would O
entail O
loss O
of O
time O
and O
labor O
; O
but O
the O
commander O
- O
in O
- O
chief O
was O
less O
disturbed O
on O
that O
account O
than O
by O
the O
fear O
that O
this O
accident O
might O
be O
misconstrued O
into O
an O
evil O
omen O
, O
and O
consequently O
dampen O
the O
enthusiasm O
of O
his O
followers O
. O

For O
at O
the O
last O
moment O
the O
Hōjō B-PERSON
had O
changed O
their O
tactics O
. O

They O
all O
at O
once O
showed O
unbounded O
honor O
and O
veneration O
for O
the O
Emperor O
whom O
they O
had O
placed O
upon O
the O
throne O
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
before I-DATE
, O
and O
took O
care O
to O
have O
their O
new O
- O
born O
loyalty O
proclaimed O
far O
and O
wide O
. O

They O
knew O
, O
as O
they O
said O
, O
that O
the O
gods O
from O
whom O
the O
Mikados B-ORG
sprang O
would O
never O
allow O
sacrilegious O
hands O
to O
be O
laid O
on O
their O
descendants O
, O
and O
in O
the O
changes O
which O
had O
been O
made O
the O
Hōjō B-PERSON
had O
merely O
been O
instruments O
ordained O
to O
work O
out O
the O
divine O
will O
by O
placing O
the O
sceptre O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
him O
who O
could O
wield O
it O
to O
the O
best O
advantage O
of O
the O
country O
. O

Numbers O
of O
Hōjō B-PERSON
spies O
had O
found O
their O
way O
into O
Nitta B-ORG
’s O
camp O
, O
where O
only B-TIME
the I-TIME
evening I-TIME
before O
some O
of O
them O
had O
been O
discovered O
and O
executed O
; O
and O
those O
undetected O
would O
certainly O
make O
the O
most O
of O
this O
unexpected O
impediment O
, O
causing O
it O
to O
be O
regarded O
as O
a O
sign O
of O
the O
displeasure O
of O
the O
gods O
and O
an O
augury O
of O
evil O
. O

Going O
down O
to O
where O
the O
waves O
washed O
his O
feet O
and O
frequently O
covered O
him O
with O
their O
spray O
, O
Nitta B-ORG
looked O
out O
over O
the O
sea O
long O
and O
earnestly O
. O

The O
white O
- O
crested O
billows O
came O
and O
went O
, O
but O
the O
last O
- O
comer O
showed O
no O
sign O
of O
lagging O
behind O
those O
that O
had O
preceded O
it O
. O

Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
seeing O
the O
anxiety O
depicted O
on O
his O
chief O
’s O
face O
, O
ventured O
to O
step O
up O
to O
him O
and O
give O
his O
opinion O
. O

He O
had O
been O
brought O
up O
in O
a O
seaport O
town O
, O
with O
a O
harbor O
which O
was O
none O
of O
the O
best O
, O
where O
he O
had O
been O
out O
at O
all O
times O

and O
had O
learned O
to O
know O
the O
tides O
and O
the O
signs O
of O
the O

Therefore O
he O
felt O
that O
he O
could O
now O
take O
it O
upon O
himself O
to O
assert O
that O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours I-TIME

or O
a B-DATE

, O
the O

Nitta B-ORG
, O
although O
he O
appeared O
absorbed O
in O
thought O
, O
and O
scarcely O
to O
listen O
to O
his O
lieutenant O
, O
eagerly O
drank O
in O
every O
word O
the O
latter O
said O
; O
and O
, O
placing O
confidence O
in O
it O

performed O
one B-CARDINAL

those O
acts O
which O
, O
trifling O
as O
they O
may O
appear O

are O

emanations O
of O

Exerting O
a O

such O
actions O
are O
often O
all O

powerful O
in O
shaping O
the O

, O
by O
giving O
decision O
to O
the O

Nitta B-ORG
cast O
it O
out O
into O

far O
as O

In O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Mikado B-PRODUCT
, O
driven O
from O
the O
throne O
into O
a O
lonely O
exile O
, O
he O
prayed O
them O
to O
bid O
the O
angry O
waves O
subside O
and O
give O
free O
passage O
to O
those O
who O
came O
to O
avenge O
his O
despoilers O
and O
punish O
the O
sacrilege O
. O

It O
was O
a O
powerful O
invocation O
, O
and O
its O
effect O
was O
thorough O
and O
instantaneous O
, O
creating O
general O
and O
unbounded O
enthusiasm O
. O

If O
any O
man O
there O
had O
misgivings O
, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
dangerous O
for O
him O
to O
express O
them O
; O
and O
when O
next B-TIME
morning I-TIME
the O
waters O
had O
subsided O

leaving O
the O
road O
free O
and O
open O
, O
all O
lingering O
doubts O
as O
well O
as O
the O
hopes O
of O

Hōjō B-PERSON
sympathizers O
vanished O
as O
the O
dew O
of O

night I-TIME
that O

in O
the O
morning O

As O
they O
approached O
Kamakura B-GPE
, O
they O
found O
a O
large O
portion O
of O
the O
enemy O

army O
posted O
before O
the O
walls O
; O
so O
fierce O

, O
was O
the O
onslaught O
of O
Nitta B-ORG

that O
the O

were O
at O
once O
broken O

fled O
for O
protection O

the O
city O

But O
the O
assailants O
were O
close O
upon O

and O
followed O
in O
such O
numbers O
that O
the O
gates O

From O

the O

persistent O

desperate O

before O
nightfall O
the O

taken O

This O

decided O
the O
war O

the O
fate O
of O
the O

The O
honest O

won O
over O

the O
spell O

power O

for O
a O
considerable O
time O
; O
and O
this O
spell O
once O
broken O
, O
they O
fully O
recognized O
their O
folly O
as O
well O
as O
their O
guilt O
, O
and O
were O
ready O
to O
sue O
for O
and O
accept O
pardon O
on O
any O
terms O

It O
was O
expected O
that O
the O
principal O
men O
of O
the O
defeated O
clan O

together O
with O
such O
of O
their O
partisans O
and O
abetters O
as O
were O
too O
deeply O
implicated O

hope O

would O
form O
into O
roving O

flee O
to O
distant O
inaccessible O
parts O

as O
they O
were O
now O
without O
physical O
or O

, O
a O
general O
engagement O
was O
no O
longer O
to O

In O

of O
this O
it O
was O
decided O
by O
Nitta B-ORG
to O
dismiss O
at O
once O
a O
part O

the O

so O
that O

employed O
in O

a O
strong O
castle O
town O
at O
the O
northern O
foot O
of O
the O
Hakone B-LOC
Mountain I-LOC
- O
range O
. O

The O
fame O
of O
his O
exploits O
had O
preceded O
him O
, O
and O
the O
lord O
of O
the O
castle O
received O
him O
in O
a O
way O
which O
could O
not O
but O
be O
flattering O
to O
the O
young O
man O
, O
pressing O
him O
to O
remain O
at B-DATE
least I-DATE
a I-DATE
day I-DATE
or O
two B-CARDINAL
longer O
. O

No O
inducement O
, O
however O
, O
could O
detain O
Sennoske B-PERSON
; O
and O
leaving O
their O
horses O
, O
which O
would O
only O
have O
impeded O
their O
way O
over O
the O
mountain O
- O
passes O
, O
he O
started O
on O
foot O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day I-DATE
at O
dawn O
with O
his O
faithful O
henchman O
. O

The O
road O
, O
as O
it O
was O
at O
that O
time O
laid O
out O
, O
wound O
between O
the O
Hakone B-GPE
and O
the B-FAC
Ashigara I-FAC
Mountain I-FAC
- I-FAC
ranges I-FAC
; O
and O
here O
the O
young O
man O
made O
perhaps O
less O
haste O
than O
might O
have O
been O
expected O
. O

It O
was O
late O
in O
autumn B-DATE
, O
the O
weather O
was O
fine O
, O
the O
air O
bracing O
; O
and O
in O
spite O
of O
his O
anxiety O
to O
reach O
his O
home O
he O
could O
not O
but O
loiter O
a O
little O
to O
view O
the O
beautiful O
scenery O
that O
presented O
itself O
. O

The O
mountains O
and O
hill O
- O
sides O
were O
clothed O
in O
their O
rich O
autumnal O
garb O
of O
gold O
and O
red O
and O
purple O
and O
brown O
of O
every O
shade O
and O
depth O
of O
coloring O
; O
while O
as O
if O
to O
supply O
the O
need O
of O
a O
stronger O
contrast O
, O
clusters O
of O
evergreen O
trees O
here O
and O
there O
reared O
their O
crowns O
of O
unchanging O
hue O
high O
into O
the O
air O
. O

The O
whole O
effect O
was O
greatly O
heightened O
by O
occasional O
glimpses O
of O
Fuji B-LOC
, O
which O
presented O
itself O
under O
the O
most O
varying O
forms O
and O
expressions O
. O

Sometimes O
just O
a O
glimpse O
of O
its O
top O
was O
visible O
over O
an O
intervening O
mountain O
- O
range O
, O
while O
again O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
huge O
mass O
would O
reveal O
itself O
through O
a O
narrow O
gorge O
; O
sometimes O
one O
of O
its O
bleak O
sides O
, O
within O
range O
of O
the O
eye O
, O
but O
up O
to O
this O
moment O
obscured O
by O
clouds O
which O
now O
suddenly O
parted O
, O
would O
astonish O
the O
traveller O
who O
had O
just O
gazed O
at O
what O
he O
thought O
empty O
space O
, O
while O
the O
shifting O
curtain O
, O
hiding O
the O
view O
the O
next O
moment O
, O
would O
make O
him O
doubt O
whether O
he O
had O
seen O
aright O
. O

Two B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
times O
the O
whole O
mountain O
with O
its O
perfect O
outline O
stood O
in O
majesty O
like O
a O
giant O
sentry O
watching O
over O
the O
land O
. O

With O
the O
varying O
beauty O
of O
scenery O
which O
each O
successive O
step O
thus O
unclosed O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
a O
lover O
of O
Nature B-WORK_OF_ART
like O
Sennoske B-PERSON
not O
to O
stop O
for O
a O
moment O
now O
and O
then O
to O
admire O
it O
. O

Yet O
it O
was O
only O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
as O
the O
thought O
of O
the O
welcome O
awaiting O
him O
prevented O
him O
from O
lingering O
as O
he O
otherwise O
would O
have O
done O
. O

Many O
a O
good O
- O
looking O
young O
girl O
at O
the O
roadside O
tea O
- O
houses O
followed O
with O
strained O
eyes O
the O
figure O
of O
the O
dashing O
young O
cavalier O
, O
whose O
pleasant O
, O
gentle O
ways O
so O
well O
set O
off O
his O
unmistakably O
martial O
air O
. O

Old O
Yamagawa B-PERSON
also O
came O
in O
for O
his O
share O
of O
attention O
; O
and O
now O
that O
they O
neared O
home O
, O
honored O
and O
successful O
, O
the O
old O
servitor O
indulged O
occasionally O
in O
what O
was O
probably O
his O
only O
fault O
— O
a O
love O
of O
wine O
— O
to O
a O
greater O
extent O
than O
was O
good O
for O
him O
; O
but O
his O
young O
master O
had O
not O
the O
heart O
to O
chide O
or O
even O
to O
restrain O
him O
. O

CHAPTER O
IX O
. O

It O
was O
late B-TIME
at I-TIME
night I-TIME
on O
the B-DATE
second I-DATE
day I-DATE
before O
Sennoske B-PERSON
arrived O
at O
Mishima B-GPE
, O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
mountains O
. O

The O
town O
was O
full O
of O
people O
; O
for O
besides O
the O
ordinary O
contingent O
of O
travellers O
, O
who O
always O
muster O
here O
in O
force O
, O
there O
were O
a O
great O
many O
samurai O
— O
some O
who O
had O
started O
too O
late O
to O
join O
the O
army O
, O
others O
, O
like O
Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
already O
returning O
home O
— O
and O
a O
considerable O
number O
of O
Hōjō B-PERSON
adherents O
fleeing O
in O
various O
disguises O
to O
find O
an O
asylum O
before O
pursuit O
was O
fairly O
organized O
against O
them O
. O

The O
inns O
and O
hostelries O
were O
over O
- O
crowded O
; O
but O
the O
Kuwana B-NORP
nobility O
had O
always O
enjoyed O
a O
good O
reputation O
on O
the O
road O
, O
and O
the O
charm O
of O
the O
young O
man O
’s O
manner O
moreover O
failed O
not O
in O
its O
usual O
effect O
; O
so O
at O
the O
inn O
at O
which O
he O
determined O
to O
stay O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
parties O
of O
merchants O
, O
already O
closely O
packed O
, O
were O
forced O
to O
content O
themselves O
with O
even O
less O
space O
in O
order O
to O
clear O
a O
room O
for O
the O
new O
arrival O
. O

Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
weary O
, O
at O
once O
repaired O
to O
the O
bath O
, O
accompanied O
by O
Yamagawa B-PERSON
, O
carrying O
the O
Muramasa B-PERSON
sword O
, O
which O
was O
never O
out O
of O
sight O
or O
reach O
of O
either O
master O
or O
servant O
. O

After O
his O
master O
had O
retired O
, O
the O
old O
servitor O
also O
indulged O
in O
the O
luxury O
of O
the O
bath O
, O
the O
daily B-DATE
use O
of O
which O
in O
Japan B-GPE
is O
considered O
almost O
a O
necessity O
. O

Already O
half B-CARDINAL
overcome O
by O
the O
fumes O
of O
the O
wine O
- O
cup O
, O
the O
hot O
bath O
and O
the O
close O
air O
of O
the O
room O
still O
further O
increased O
his O
stupefaction O
; O
and O
in O
returning O
to O
his O
apartment O
he O
staggered O
along O
the O
corridor O
in O
a O
confused O
, O
aimless O
manner O
, O
until O
, O
mistaking O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
passages O
, O
he O
stopped O
at O
the O
end O
of O
it O
before O
what O
of O
course O
was O
the O
wrong O
room O
. O

The O
sound O
of O
unknown O
voices O
from O
within O
reached O
his O
ears O
; O
but O
thinking O
they O
must O
belong O
to O
visitors O
of O
his O
master O
, O
he O
unhesitatingly O
opened O
the O
paper O
sliding O
- O
doors O
, O
and O
falling O
on O
his O
hands O
and O
knees O
with O
his O
head O
bowed O
down O
, O
in O
the O
fashion O
of O
Japanese B-NORP
servants O
, O
he O
pushed O
the O
sword O
forward O
as O
far O
as O
he O
could O
, O
uttering O
the O
customary O
phrase O
, O
“ O
Have O
you O
any O
further O
orders O
for O
me O
? O
” O

Receiving O
no O
answer O
, O
and O
fearing O
that O
Sennoske B-PERSON
had O
noticed O
his O
drunken O
condition O
and O
was O
displeased O
at O
his O
showing O
it O
before O
visitors O
— O
something O
which O
heretofore O
had O
never O
happened O
— O
he O
remained O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
or O
two B-CARDINAL
in O
his O
prostrate O
position O
, O
bowing O
his O
head O
still O
lower O
, O
and O
muttering O
apologies O
. O

At O
last O
a O
voice O
which O
he O
did O
not O
recognize O
spoke O
out O
: O
“ O
We O
will O
excuse O
you O
because O
you O
insist O
on O
being O
excused O
; O
but O
tell O
us O
first B-ORDINAL
what O
it O
is O
that O
you O
require O
, O
and O
what O
brings O
you O
hither O
. O
” O

Yamagawa B-PERSON
looked O
up O
, O
and O
the O
sight O
that O
presented O
itself O
, O
unexpected O
as O
it O
was O
, O
partly O
sobered O
him O
. O

There O
were O
six B-CARDINAL
or O
seven B-CARDINAL
samurai O
, O
all O
unknown O
to O
him O
, O
seated O
on O
the O
mats O
; O
and O
the O
foremost O
among O
them O
, O
who O
also O
was O
the O
last O
speaker O
, O
had O
taken O
up O
the O
sword O
pushed O
towards O
him O
, O
and O
, O
regarding O
it O
with O
the O
eye O
of O
a O
connoisseur O
, O
was O
evidently O
surprised O
at O
the O
rich O
ornamentation O
and O
workmanship O
. O

“ O
Give O
me O
back O
my O
sword O
, O
” O
Yamagawa B-PERSON
cried O
; O
“ O
it O
belongs O
to O
my O
master O
, O
and O
I O
am O
responsible O
for O
it O
. O

Give O
it O
back O
to O
me O
, O
oh O
! O
please O
give O
it O
back O
to O
me O
at O
once O
, O
” O
he O
repeated O
, O
raising O
his O
voice O
and O
eagerly O
holding O
out O
his O
hands O
. O

“ O
Gently O
, O
my O
man O
! O

Of O
course O
I O
shall O
give O
it O
back O
to O
you O
, O
” O
said O
the O
other O
; O
“ O
but O
do O
not O
be O
so O
importunate O
, O
and O
do O
not O
speak O
so O
loudly O
before O
your O
superiors O
, O
or O
you O
will O
have O
to O
be O
taught O
better O
manners O
. O

Who O
is O
your O
master O
? O
” O

“ O
His O
name O
is O
Sennoske B-PERSON
Mutto I-PERSON
, O
from O
Kuwana B-GPE
, O
and O
he O
is O
just O
returning O
home O
from O
the O
war O
, O
” O
was O
the O
reply O
. O

“ O
This O
is O
a O
Muramasa B-PERSON
sword O
, O
which O
he O
values O
highly O
, O
and O
he O
will O
begin O
to O
be O
anxious O
about O
it O
; O
so O
please O
give O
it O
back O
to O
me O
at O
once O
, O
” O
pleaded O
the O
old O
man O
. O

He O
was O
still O
partly O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
wine O
; O
and O
this O
fact O
, O
together O
with O
the O
mortification O
of O
his O
position O
and O
the O
anxiety O
and O
irritation O
under O
which O
he O
labored O
, O
had O
made O
him O
forget O
discretion O
, O
common O
sense O
, O
and O
his O
dignity O
as O
a O
samurai O
, O
all O
other O
considerations O
being O
merged O
and O
lost O
in O
his O
impatient O
eagerness O
to O
regain O
possession O
of O
the O
cherished O
weapon O
. O

“ O
A O
Muramasa B-PERSON
sword O
, O
and O
your O
master O
intrusts O
it O
to O
a O
drunken O
fool O
like O
you O
! O
” O
said O
another O
of O
the O
party O
, O
who O
until O
now O
had O
been O
sitting O
in O
the O
rear O
of O
his O
companions O
, O
but O
who O
now O
moved O
forward O
to O
where O
the O
light O
fell O
fully O
upon O
him O
. O

“ O
Does O
he O
attach O
so O
little O
value O
to O
it O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
what O
you O
say O
, O
as O
to O
leave O
it O
like O
a O
toy O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
one O
who O
in O
his O
cups O
would O
not O
mind O
trading O
it O
off O
for O
a O
measure O
of O
wine O
? O

His O
opinion O
differs O
from O
mine O
as O
to O
the O
care O
which O
he O
ought O
to O
bestow O
upon O
it O
. O

Be O
off O
! O
and O
tell O
your O
master O
that O
if O
he O
wants O
this O
sword O
he O
must O
come O
for O
it O
himself O
. O
” O

What O
was O
it O
which O
, O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
new O
speaker O
and O
at O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
word O
uttered O
by O
him O
, O
made O
the O
old O
man O
look O
as O
if O
petrified O
with O
horror O
and O
stupefaction O
, O
clammy O
perspiration O
bathing O
his O
face O
, O
while O
his O
hair O
literally O
stood O
on O
end O
? O

Only O
his O
eyes O
spoke O
; O
and O
although O
fastened O
with O
almost O
stony O
fixedness O
upon O
the O
man O
who O
had O
just O
addressed O
him O
, O
they O
yet O
had O
an O
expression O
of O
such O
intense O
, O
deadly O
hatred O
that O
the O
other O
, O
as O
he O
fairly O
caught O
sight O
of O
it O
, O
involuntarily O
recoiled O
a O
step O
and O
laid O
his O
hand O
on O
the O
sword O
he O
carried O
at O
his O
side O
. O

Gradually O
, O
by O
a O
series O
of O
sharp O
, O
convulsive O
movements O
, O
Yamagawa B-PERSON
’s O
form O
and O
features O
relaxed O
from O
their O
rigid O
cast O
, O
and O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
a O
full O
consciousness O
of O
his O
position O
and O
surroundings O
was O
slowly O
taking O
hold O
of O
him O
, O
and O
that O
as O
it O
did O
so O
he O
was O
making O
powerful O
efforts O
to O
regain O
his O
self O
- O
control O
. O

Every O
trace O
of O
drunkenness O
had O
disappeared O
, O
and O
it O
was O
only O
extreme O
mental O
and O
nervous O
excitement O
which O
made O
his O
voice O
tremble O
when O
he O
again O
spoke O
: O
— O
“ O
Give O
me O
back O
the O
sword O
, O
Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
; O
and O
after O
returning O
it O
to O
my O
young O
master O
, O
I O
will O
try O
to O
refrain O
from O
telling O
him O
or O
his O
father O
that O
I O
have O
again O
met O
you O
. O

Perhaps O
I O
am O
selfish O
enough O
not O
to O
wish O
to O
stand O
disgraced O
before O
one B-CARDINAL
in O
the O
service O
of O
whose O
family O
I O
have O
become O
old O
and O
gray O
, O
whose O
welfare O
has O
occupied O
every O
thought O
of O
my O
mind O
, O
to O
whom O
every O
fibre O
of O
my O
body O
is O
devoted O
, O
and O
for O
whose O
sake O
I O
would O
willingly O
shed O
my O
blood O
drop O
by O
drop O
. O

Perhaps O
I O
have O
become O
too O
feeble O
in O
mind O
as O
well O
as O
in O
body O
fully O
to O
realize O
the O
duties O
of O
a O
samurai O
, O
for O
I O
would O
fain O
save O
my O
young O
master O
from O
facing O
one O
who O
has O
been O
the O
curse O
of O
his O
house O
, O
instead O
of O
doing O
my O
utmost O
to O
bring O
about O
a O
meeting O
, O
so O
that O
he O
could O
either O
kill O
you O
or O
fall O
as O
a O
samurai O
should O
. O

As O
for O
me O
, O
I O
know O
I O
shall O
not O
long O
be O
able O
to O
endure O
the O
thought O
of O
having O
met O
you O
and O
not O
only O
failed O
myself O
to O
take O
vengeance O
, O
but O
even O
shielded O
you O
against O
punishment O
by O
those O
whose O
right O
and O
duty O
it O
is O
to O
inflict O
it O
. O

For O
twelve B-DATE

there O
has O
never O

a B-DATE

you O

Yet O
all O
the O

so O
far O

are O
as O
nothing O

the O

The O

seem O
kind O

our O

I O
am O
still O
able O
to O
strike O
at O
the O
only O
one O
whom O
, O
from O
some O
foolish O
whim O

I O
spared O
, O
leaving O
him O
life O

when O
I O
had O
the O
power O

alive O

you O
now O
serve O
his O
son O

Well O
, O
the O
brat O
has O
his O
father O
’s O
courage O
, O
as O
he O
showed O
in O
the O
war O
; O
and O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
he O
has O
also O
the O
same O
conceit O

Curse O
you O
all O

with O
your O
pretended O
fine O
feelings O

which O
you O
constantly O
flaunt O

our O
eyes O

will O
not O
impose O
upon O
me O

Go O
, O
and O
repeat O
to O
your O
master O
what O
has O
been O
told O
to O
you O
here O
; O
go O
, O
and O
tell O
him O
that O
if O
he O
knows O
a O
samurai O
’s O
duties O
, O
of O
which O
his O
father O
always O
prated O
so O
much O
, O
he O
must O
be O
aware O
that O
a O
drunkard O
is O
not O
fit O
to O
be O
intrusted O
with O
a O
sword O
, O
least O
of O

with O

like O
this O

Go O

tell O
him O
that O
if O
he O
cares O
for O
it O
more O
than O
you O
seem O
to O
have O
done O
, O
he O
must O
come O

humbly O
beg O
for O
it O
himself O

” O

There O
was O
somewhat O
of O
truth O
in O
this O
taunt O
, O
which O
the O
devilish O
cunning O
of O
the O
other O
had O
formulated O
so O
as O
to O
make O
it O
more O
cutting O
than O
the O
keenest O
- O
edged O
weapon O
. O

Seeing O
from O
the O
tenor O
of O
it O
that O
all O
further O
parley O
would O
be O
useless O
, O
Yamagawa B-PERSON
without O
another O
word O
or O
look O
made O
his O
way O
back O
to O
his O
master O
’s O
room O
. O

As O
he O
entered O
, O
Sennoske B-PERSON
started O
in O
amazement O
and O
affright O
at O
the O
change O
which O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
had O
effected O
in O
the O
appearance O
of O
his O
old O
servant O
. O

The O
signs O
of O
acute O
physical O
pain O
, O
as O
well O
as O
of O
mental O
anguish O
, O
were O
graven O
in O
deep O
lines O
on O
his O
features O
, O
and O
spoke O
with O
equal O
emphasis O
out O
of O
his O
hollow O
, O
sunken O
eyes O
; O
shuffling O
along O
as O
he O
did O
on O
his O
right O
side O
, O
with O
his O
right O
hand O
convulsively O
clasping O
his O
left O
bosom O
, O
it O
is O
probable O
that O
the O
terrible O
ordeal O
through O
which O
he O
had O
passed O
, O
had O
brought O
on O
a O
partial O
heart O
- O
stroke O
. O

Yet O
overlying O
all O
these O
manifestations O
of O
suffering O
, O
which O
became O
almost O
tangible O
and O
somatic O
as O
it O
were O
by O
comparison O
, O
there O
was O
a O
look O
of O
utter O
, O
hopeless O
despair O
— O
such O
a O
look O
as O
is O
seen O
in O
certain O
types O
of O
incurable O
madness O
; O
such O
a O
look O
as O
hunters O
see O
in O
some O
animals O
hunted O
down O
to O
the O
last O
stages O
of O
exhaustion O
, O
with O
the O
dogs O
fastening O
on O
them O
, O
and O
no O
hope O
of O

. O

In O
a O
sufficiently O
coherent O
way O
to O
make O
himself O
understood O
, O
Yamagawa B-PERSON
explained O
the O
circumstances O
attending O
the O
loss O
of O
the O
sword O
, O
without O
, O
however O
, O
hinting O
at O
the O
identity O
of O
the O
samurai O
whom O
he O
had O
recognized O
among O
his O
despoilers O
. O

Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
although O
greatly O
annoyed O
and O
angry O
at O
the O
impudence O
of O
the O
demand O
transmitted O
to O
him O
, O
showed O
no O
outward O
signs O
of O
perturbation O
, O
and O
in O
reality O
a O
sincere O
pity O
for O
the O
poor O
old O
man O
before O
him O
mastered O
every O
other O
emotion O
. O

From O
the O
version O
given O
to O
him O
, O
he O
could O
of O
course O
scarcely O
understand O
why O
this O
accident O
, O
although O
implying O
a O
serious O
neglect O
of O
duty O
on O
the O
part O
of O
Yamagawa B-ORG
according O
to O
the O
code O
then O
prevailing O
, O
should O
yet O
have O
affected O
the O
old O
servitor O
in O
such O
a O
terrible O
way O
; O
and O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
latter O
’s O
urgent O
solicitation O
to O
go O
at O
once O
about O
the O
recovery O
of O
his O
weapon O
, O
he O
stayed O
to O
console O
and O
cheer O
him O
. O

“ O
Sorrow O
is O
bad O
for O
old O
age O
, O
” O
he O
said O
; O
“ O
it O
withers O
up O
the O
tree O
of O
life O
quicker O

surer O

are O
nearing O

As O
soon O
as O
I O
have O
regained O
my O

I O
shall O
feel O
like O
teaching O

lesson O

you O
may O

“ O

“ O
Oh O
, O
pray O
, O
my O

go O
at O
once O

this O
suspense O
is O
horrible O
. O
” O

Sennoske B-PERSON
at O
these O
words O
started O
up O
, O
filled O
with O
dark O
forebodings O
. O

He O
felt O
that O
there O
must O
be O
something O
more O
in O
this O
affair O
than O
he O
yet O
apprehended O
, O
and O
he O
hesitated O
no O
longer O
. O

Calling O
a O
servant O
, O
he O
had O
himself O
conducted O
to O
the O
room O
which O
Yamagawa B-ORG
had O
mistakenly O
entered O
; O
and O
announcing O
his O
name O
, O
made O
a O
fair O
apology O
for O
what O
had O
occurred O
, O
and O
courteously O
but O
firmly O
asked O
for O
the O
return O
of O
his O
sword O
. O

Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
sent O
him O
the O
message O
to O
come O
, O
and O
who O
was O
evidently O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
party O
, O
replied O
to O
him O
in O
what O
was O
plainly O
a O
prepared O
speech O
: O
— O
“ O
I O
have O
heard O
of O
you O
, O
Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
and O
of O
the O
renown O
which O
you O
have O
gained O
on O
the O
field O
of O
battle O
; O
but O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
this O
, O
you O
are O
greatly O
deficient O
in O
the O
duties O
and O
obligations O
of O
a O
samurai O
. O

Courage O
and O
bravery O
and O
prowess O
in O
battle O
are O
common O
enough O
in O
our O
country O
; O
but O
a O
sword O
like O
this O
of O
yours O
is O
rarely O
found O
, O
and O
its O
possession O
probably O
more O
than O
any O
quality O
of O
your O
own O
has O
helped O
you O
to O
achieve O
success O
and O
renown O
. O

You O
know O
the O
old O
saying O
, O
‘ O
The O
sword O
is O
the O
soul O
of O
the O
samurai O
. O
’ O

It O
owes O
its O
origin O
to O
a O
feeling O
hallowed O
by O
the O
custom O
of O
centuries O
— O
a O
feeling O
which O
has O
been O
outraged O
by O
the O
careless O
, O
negligent O
way O
in O
which O
this O
treasure O
has O
been O
handled O
. O

Your O
youth O
and O
inexperience O
may O
plead O
in O
extenuation O
of O
yourself O
, O
but O
the O
fault O
of O
your O
retainer O
, O
who O
is O
a O
samurai O
, O
and O
old O
enough O
to O
know O
his O
duty O
, O
can O
not O
be O
condoned O
; O
and O
we O
will O
listen O
to O
no O
demand O
for O
the O
restoration O
of O
this O
blade O
unless O
it O
is O
accompanied O
by O
the O
head O
of O
that O
drunken O
brute O
through O
whose O
culpable O
carelessness O
it O
might O
easily O
have O
been O
lost O
or O
spoiled O
. O
” O

“ O
But O
this O
is O
preposterous O
, O
” O
Sennoske B-PERSON
rejoined O
; O
“ O
this O
is O
horrible O
! O

You O
surely O
can O
not O
mean O
what O
you O
say O
— O
and O
yet O
the O
life O
of O
a O
faithful O
old O
retainer O
is O
not O
a O
fit O
subject O
for O
sport O
. O

I O
recollect O
him O
from O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
when O
consciousness O
first O
dawned O
upon O
me O
; O
memory O
recalls O
him O
as O
watching O
over O
my O
childhood O
, O
guiding O
and O
instructing O
my O
early O
youth O
, O
in O
the O
most O
disinterested O
, O
self O
- O
sacrificing O
way O
. O

I O
would O
willingly O
risk O
my O
life O
for O
him O
at O
any O
moment O
; O
and O
sword O
was O
never O
yet O
forged O
, O
nor O
ever O
will O
be O
, O
which O
could O
weigh O
equally O
in O
the O
balance O
with O
such O
faithfulness O
and O
such O
devotion O
as O
he O
has O
always O
shown O
. O

I O
respect O
your O
feelings O
; O
but O
this O
man O
has O
suffered O
more O
than O
enough O
already O
for O
his O
one B-CARDINAL
fault O
. O

I O
again O
beg O
you O
to O
return O
me O
the O
sword O
which O
belongs O
to O
me O
, O
and O
to O
which O
no O
one O
but O
myself O
can O
lay O
any O
claim O
. O
” O

Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
although O
greatly O
excited O
and O
incensed O
, O
had O
succeeded O
in O
repressing O
any O
outward O
signs O
of O
excitement O
or O
anger O
; O
he O
had O
spoken O
with O
quiet O
dignity O
, O
and O
when O
referring O
to O
the O
man O
whom O
he O
had O
left O
in O
such O
a O
dejected O
state O
his O
tones O
became O
tender O
and O
pathetic O
. O

It O
appeared O
to O
him O
that O
the O
whole O
proceeding O
was O
a O
deliberate O
attempt O
to O
deprive O
him O
of O
his O
matchless O
blade O
; O
yet O
— O
to O
his O
honor O
be O
it O
said O
— O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
the O
idea O
of O
its O
possible O
loss O
troubled O
him O
less O
than O
the O
thought O
of O
the O
probable O
effect O
of O
that O
loss O
on O
his O
old O
retainer O
. O

His O
solicitude O
for O
Yamagawa B-PERSON
caused O
him O
to O
be O
wary O
, O
and O
to O
show O
more O
moderation O
in O
his O
speech O
than O
he O
otherwise O
would O
have O
done O
, O
in O
view O
of O
the O
arrogant O
manner O
in O
which O
he O
had O
been O
treated O
. O

The O
next O
answer O
which O
he O
received O
, O
however O
, O
was O
well O
calculated O
, O
in O
its O
cold O
, O
sneering O
, O
and O
evidently O
studied O
insolence O
of O
tone O
and O
bearing O
, O
to O
make O
him O
lose O
every O
vestige O
of O
self O
- O
control O

“ O
Go O
to O

said O

“ O

This O
sentimental O
twaddle O
may O
do O
when O
you O
meet O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
grown O
girls O
who O
admire O
softness O

meekness O

or O
when O
you O
are O
in O
the O
company O

enervated O
Shingon B-PERSON

who O
would O
fain O
palliate O
their O

condition O
by O
holding O
up O
soft O

hearted O
effeminacy O
as O
something O
to O

I O
would O
sacrifice O
by O
the O

by O
the B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL

good O

breath O
to O
gain O

he O
corrected O
himself O

It O
was O
the O
very O
extremity O
of O
the O
provocation O
which O
for O
a O
moment O
paralyzed O
Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
and O
that O
moment O
was O
sufficient O
for O
his O
presence O
of O
mind O
partially O
at O

to O
assert O
itself O
. O

He O
understood O
the O
object O
of O
the O
insult O
offered O
to O
him O
, O
and O
he O
could O
see O
that O
the O
least O
indiscretion O
, O
a O
single O
false O
step O
, O
would O
insure O
his O
own O
destruction O

Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
while O
talking O
had O
, O
contrary O
to O
all O
rule O
and O
etiquette O
, O
drawn O
the O
sword O
out O
of O
its O
scabbard O
, O
and O
while O
apparently O
playing O
with O
the O
naked O
blade O
, O
and O
weighing O
it O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
had O
never O
allowed O
his O
sinister O
eye O
for O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
to O
be O
removed O
from O
the O
face O
of O
the O
young O
soldier O
. O

All O
the O
other O
inmates O
of O
the O
room O
had O
half B-CARDINAL
risen O
, O
and O
their O
hands O
were O
suspiciously O
near O
their O
sword O
- O
hilts O
. O

It O
had O
flashed O
through O
Sennoske B-PERSON

mind O
to O
throw O
himself O
forward O
and O
try O
to O
wrench O
the O
sword O
from O
the O
other O

hands O
; O
but O
opposed O
as O
he O
was O
by O
seven B-CARDINAL
resolute O
men O
, O
and O
only O
partially O
armed O
himself O
, O
with O
nothing O
but O
his O
short O
dirk O
in O
his O
girdle O
, O
he O
abandoned O
the O
thought O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
came O
, O
knowing O
that O
such O
an O
attempt O
would O
be O
the O
height O
of O
madness O
. O

Yet O
he O
felt O
that O
his O
self O
- O
command O
was O
fast O
leaving O
him O
, O
and O
that O
another O
speech O
like O
the O
last O
would O
surely O
precipitate O
him O
to O
his O
own O
destruction O
; O
so O
he O
withdrew O
abruptly O
, O
to O
collect O
himself O
and O
to O
resolve O
upon O
some O
course O
of O
action O
. O

The O
servant O
who O
had O
brought O
him O
hither O
, O
and O
who O
under O
pretence O
, O
probably O
, O
of O
waiting O
for O
orders O
had O
listened O
to O
the O
whole O
conversation O
, O
conducted O
him O
back O
to O
his O
own O
room O

On O
entering O
it O
he O
found O
there O
a O
number O
of O
superior O
Ise B-ORG
officers O
, O
who O
, O
hurrying O
back O
like O
himself O
, O
had O
just O
arrived O
, O

to O
whom O
Yamagawa B-PERSON
had O
told O
the O
affair O

the O
sword O

One B-CARDINAL
look O
at O
his O
master O
satisfied O
the O
old O
servitor O
that O
the O
former O

mission O

been O
unsuccessful O
; O

he O
could O

to O
spare O
him O
the O
shock O
of O
the O
communication O

for O

only O
evasive O

look O
at O
the O

standing O
by O

half B-CARDINAL

open O
door O

with O
eyes O

intent O
upon O
what O
was O

divined O
that O

at O
the O

pulling O
him O
in O
by O
the O

ordered O
him O
, O
with O
short O
word O
of O
command O
, O
to O
tell O
all O
he O
had O
heard O
there O
. O

To O
do O
this O
was O
of O
course O
a O
serious O
breach O
of O
etiquette O
; O
it O
was O
, O
however O
, O
with O
no O
thought O
of O
taking O
umbrage O
at O
the O
freedom O
assumed O
by O
his O
old O
servitor O
, O
but O
only O
to O
spare O
him O
the O
shock O
of O
what O
was O
coming O
, O
that O
Sennoske B-PERSON
interfered O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
his O
assumed O
displeasure O
remained O
unheeded O
, O
and O
even O
unnoticed O
. O

Giving O
the O
young O
fellow O
a O
good O
shaking O
, O
Yamagawa B-PERSON
again O
ordered O
him O
to O
repeat O
what O

taken O

in O
the O

; O
and O
trembling O
and O
stammering O
, O
the O

in O
spite O
of O
his O
fright O
, O
gave O
a O
sufficiently O
lucid O
account O
of O
what O
he O
had O
witnessed O
. O

A O
muttered O
word O
, O
or O
rather O
ejaculation O
, O
unintelligible O

those O
present O
, O
was O
the O
old O

returned O
to O
his O

in O

, O
however O
, O
he O
moved O
round O
, O
so O
as O
partly O
to O
turn O
his O
back O
to O
his O
companions O
. O

No O
one O
spoke O
. O

The O
men O
present O
were O
mostly O
veterans O
, O
men O
of O
action O
and O
not O
of O
words O
; O
and O
every O
one O
was O
considering O
the O
circumstances O
of O
the O
case O
, O
revolving O
within O
himself O
what O
had O
best O
be O
done O
before O

gave O

to O
his O
thoughts O

The O
dead O
silence O
, O
which O
was O
in O
strange O
contrast O
with O
the O
sound O
of O
laughter O
and O
revelry O
borne O
to O
them O
from O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
house O
, O
was O
gloomy O
, O
and O
had O
begun O
to O
be O
oppressive O
, O
when O
it O
was O
broken O
by O
the O
sound O
of O
something O
trickling O
on O
the O
mats O
. O

All O
started O
, O
but O
Sennoske B-PERSON
was O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
to O
divine O
its O
terrible O
import O
. O

A O
single O
bound O
brought O
him O
to O
the O
side O
of O
Yamagawa B-ORG
; O
but O
it O
was O
too O
late O
. O

The O
latter O
on O
turning O
round O
had O
arranged O
his O
dress O
in O
conformity O
with O
the O
rule O
on O
such O
occasions O
, O
and O
had O
quietly O
and O
noiselessly O
committed O
hara O

kiri O

He O
had O
done O
it O
deliberately O
and O
carefully O
, O
and O
the O
wound O
which O
he O
had O
inflicted O
upon O

CHAPTER O
X. O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
great O
grief O
which O
his O
young O
life O
had O
known O
now O
came O
upon O
Sennoske B-PERSON
as O
he O
knelt O
by O
the O
side O
of O
his O
old O

. O

A B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
recollections O
of O
the O
watchful O
care O
, O
kindness O
, O
and O
unvarying O
zeal O
and O
attachment O
of O
Yamagawa B-PERSON
overwhelmed O
him O
, O
until O
he O
became O
thoroughly O
unmanned O
, O
and O
could O
only O
sob O
in O
a O
broken O
voice O
: O
“ O
Oh O
, O
Yamagawa B-PERSON
! O

why O
have O
you O
done O
this O
to O
me O
? O
” O

“ O
Listen O
to O
me O
, O
Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
” O
replied O
the O
old O
samurai O
— O
whose O
present O
composure O
and O
serenity O
were O
in O
striking O
contrast O
with O
his O
appearance O
of O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
before O
, O
his O
face O
, O
which O
showed O
no O
evidence O
of O
physical O
pain O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
suffering O
caused O
by O
his O
wound O
, O
being O
lit O
up O
by O
a O
happy O
smile O
at O
the O
evident O
deep O
- O
felt O
love O
and O
sympathy O
expressed O
by O
his O
young O
master—“listen B-PERSON
to O
me O
carefully O
, O
for O
my O
time O
is O
short O
. O
” O

As O
he O
spoke O
, O
he O
compressed O
tightly O
with O
both O
hands O
the O
gaping O
wound O
from O
which O
his O
blood O
and O
life O
were O
slowly O
oozing O
out O
. O

“ O

with O
his O

, O

still O
sobbing O
bitterly O

motioned O

only O
whetted O

In O
the O
most O

he O

went O
one B-CARDINAL
way O
and O
he O
another O
. O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
, O
like O
a O
thief O
and O
a O
malefactor O
, O
he O
left O
the O
place O
where O
until O
now O
he O
had O
been O
foremost O
in O
rank O
and O
position O
, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
the O
esteem O
of O
the O
people O
. O

We O
met O
by O
appointment O
in O
a O
mountain O
retreat O
of O
Idzu B-PRODUCT
, O
at O
the O
house O
of O
an O
old O
friend O
and O
companion O
- O
in O
- O
arms O
who O
had O
turned O
priest O
and O
was O
leading O
a O
quiet O
, O
secluded O
life O
. O

There O
we O
remained O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
which O
enabled O
your O
father O
to O
regain O
his O
tranquillity O
; O
and O
then O
we O
travelled O
on O
to O
Kuwana B-GPE
, O
where O
, O
as O
you O
know O
, O
he O
took O
service O
with O
Ono B-PERSON
ga I-PERSON
Sawa I-PERSON
. O

When O
making O
arrangements O
for O
his O
flight O
he O
had O
taken O
care O
, O
in O
his O
fear O
for O
the O
safety O
of O
his O
master O
’s O
sons O
, O
that O
Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
should O
be O
informed O
after O
his O
departure O
that O
he O
had O
fled O
to O
a O
life O
of O
seclusion O
, O
and O
would O
sacredly O
keep O
the O
vow O
he O
had O
taken O
. O

He O
has O
since O
often O
regretted O
his O
twofold O
promise O
; O
for O
tidings O
which O
reached O
him O
from O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
friends O
who O
remained O
true O
to O
him O
left O
very O
little O
doubt O
that O
the O
young O
dukes O
had O
really O
been O
killed O
, O
and O
that O
Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
’s O
version O
of O
their O
exile O
was O
a O
fabrication O
to O
work O
upon O
the O
feelings O
of O
a O
noble O
mind O
which O
had O
proved O
itself O
superior O
to O
all O
sordid O
influences O
. O
” O

The O
kakioki B-ORG
here O
came O
to O
an O
end O
, O
concluding O
with O
the O
usual O
formulas O
, O
stamp O
, O
and O
seal O
pertaining O
to O
such O
a O
document O
. O

During O
the O
reading O
, O
Yamagawa B-PERSON
had O
retained O
his O
death O
- O
grip O
on O
his O
wound O
. O

Superior O
will O
- O
power O
made O
him O
oblivious O
to O
physical O
pain O
, O
and O
enabled O
him O
to O
retain O
consciousness O
until O
the O
testament O
had O
been O
read O
to O
the O
end O
. O

Motioning B-PERSON
now O
to O
Sennoske B-PERSON
to O
come O
nearer O
, O
and O
summoning O
all O
his O
energies O
, O
he O
succeeded O
, O
although O
in O
a O
scarcely O
audible O
whisper O
, O
in O
saying O
his O
final O
words O
: O
— O
“ O
From O
what O
I O
have O
learned O
in O
the O
course O
of O
this O
campaign O
from O
men O
of O
our O
old O
province O
who O
no O
longer O
feared O
the O
Hōjō B-PERSON
, O
the O
doubt O
as O
to O
the O
fate O
of O
Ando B-PERSON
Goro I-PERSON
’s O
sons O
has O
resolved O
itself O
into O
a O
certainty O
. O

I O
ought O
to O
have O
acquainted O
you O
with O
all O
this O
at O
once O
, O
causing O
you O
to O
search O
out O
that O
venomous O
beast O
, O
Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
; O
but O
I O
hesitated O
, O
knowing O
him O
to O
be O
as O
cunning O
as O
he O
is O
wicked O
, O
and O
brave O
and O
strong O
withal O
. O

I O
also O
wished O
to O
let O
you O
first B-ORDINAL
enjoy O
the O
pleasure O
and O
triumph O
that O
await O
you O
at O
home O
; O
and O
I O
half O
hoped O
and O
half O
wished O
that O
before O
long O
he O
would O
meet O
his O
just O
doom O
at O
other O
hands O
. O

I O
have O
erred O
grievously O
in O
believing O
that O
the O
Fates O
which O
govern O
the O
world O
would O
allow O
such O
a O
just O
vengeance O
to O
remain O
unfulfilled O
by O
him O
who O
evidently O
was O
designed O
to O
execute O
it O
. O

The O
signal O
way O
in O
which O
the O
divine O
will O
has O
been O
declared O
in O
this O
instance O
proves O
to O
me O
also O
that O
I O
need O
have O
no O
fear O
for O
the O
result O
. O

I O
die O
happy O
in O
this O
consciousness O
; O
and O
now O
, O
Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
although O
I O
am O
of O
inferior O
rank O
, O
I O
know O
you O
will O
show O
me O
the O
last O
and O
greatest O
mark O
of O
friendship O
which O
one B-CARDINAL
samurai O
can O
show O
to O
another O
. O
” O

As O
he O
spoke O
he O
released O
the O
grip O
of O
his O
hands O
, O
the O
ghastly O
wound O
opened O
wide O
, O
and O
he O
fell O
partly O
forward O
, O
with O
life O
evidently O
very O
nearly O
extinct O
. O

Sennoske B-PERSON
did O
not O
hesitate O
, O
for O
to O
withhold O
his O
hand O
now O
would O
have O
been O
cruel O
as O
well O
as O
contrary O
to O
all O
law O
and O
usage O
. O

Taking O
Yamagawa B-PERSON
’s O
sword O
and O
grasping O
it O
firmly O
in O
both O
hands O
, O
with O
a O
muttered O
blessing O
which O
the O
other O
seemed O
to O
understand O
and O
acknowledge O
by O
a O
last O
flicker O
illuminating O
his O
face O
, O
his O
young O
master O
made O
one B-CARDINAL
sweeping O
downward O
stroke O
. O

The O
head O
rolled O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
a O
life O
of O
patient O
, O
unselfish O

sacrificing O
devotion O
came O
to O
a O
sad O

an O
honorable O

CHAPTER B-LAW
XI I-LAW
. O

“ O
Now O
for O
Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
! O
” O
cried O
a O
younger O
member O
of O
the O
party O
, O
excitedly O
. O

But O
he O
said O
no O
more O
, O
and O
hung O
his O
head O
abashed O
; O
for O
a O
stern O
glance O
from O
his O
older O
companions O
showed O
him O
plainly O
that O
many O
words O
and O
loud O
talk O
were O
not O
only O
not O
needed O
, O
but O
even O
out O
of O
place O
at O
this O
moment O
. O

In O
glancing O
round O
the O
room O
, O
Sennoske B-PERSON
saw O
the O
servant O
who O
had O
attended O
him O
, O
and O
who O
, O
fascinated O
by O
what O
he O
had O
seen O
and O
heard O
, O
had O
remained O
unnoticed O
in O
a O
corner O
. O

He O
was O
summoned O
, O
and O
told O
to O
put O
Yamagawa B-PERSON
’s O
head O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
platters O
lying O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
and O
to O
precede O
the O
young O
soldier O
to O
his O
enemy O
’s O
room O
. O

The O
poor O
fellow O
hardly O
appreciated O
the O
active O
part O
assigned O
to O
him O
in O
this O
drama O
. O

“ O
I O
am O
not O
used O
to O
carrying O
cut O
- O
off O
heads O
, O
” O
he O
stammered O
; O
“ O
I O
shall O
be O
certain O
to O
commit O
some O
breach O
of O
etiquette O
: O
so O
please O
excuse O
me O
. O
” O

As O
he O
spoke O
, O
with O
his O
head O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
raising O
it O
at O
every O
few O
words O
to O
look O
around O
in O
a O
half O
- O
frightened O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
foolish O
sort O
of O
way O
, O
and O
bringing O
it O
down O
again O
with O
a O
hard O
thump O
in O
the O
unconscious O
excess O
of O
his O
apologetic O
speech O
, O
his O
appearance O
under O
other O
circumstances O
would O
certainly O
have O
been O
sufficiently O
ludicrous O
. O

A O
reiterated O
command O
caused O
him O
to O
slide O
upon O
his O
knees O
to O
where O
the O
ghastly O
head O
lay O
on O
the O
floor O
; O
but O
as O
he O
brought O
his O
hands O
near O
it O
, O
his O
courage O
failed O
him O
, O
and O
he O
made O
a O
precipitate O
rush O
for O
the O
door O
. O

He O
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
leave O
, O
however O
, O
and O
a O
sharp O
blow O
with O
a O
scabbard O
across O
his O
shoulders O
by O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
party O
, O
an O
old O
soldier O
who O
had O
little O
sympathy O
for O
such O
scruples O
or O
squeamishness O
, O
caused O
the O
physical O
pain O
partly O
to O
overcome O
his O
nervous O
sensitiveness O
. O

Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
with O
his O
usual O
consideration O
for O
the O
feelings O
of O
others O
, O
seeing O
the O
state O
of O
mind O
the O
man O
was O
in O
, O
himself O
gently O
placed O
the O
head O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
platters O
; O
and O
the O
servant O
, O
with O
averted O
face O
, O
then O
took O
heart O
to O
raise O
it O
up O
and O
to O
proceed O
to O
the O
room O
of O
Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
. O

The O
others O
present O
followed O
, O
but O
remained O
slightly O
in O
the O
rear O
, O
having O
received O
strict O
orders O
from O
the O
young O
soldier O
not O
to O
interfere O
or O
take O
any O
active O
part O
unless O
he O
called O
upon O
them O
. O

Sennoske B-PERSON
felt O
a O
wild O
, O
fierce O
delight O
at O
the O
thought O
of O
the O
struggle O
before O
him O
. O

Physical O
action O
is O
always O
a O
relief O
for O
any O
great O
nervous O
strain O
, O
and O
there O
are O
none O
but O
the O
veriest O
cravens O
who O
will O
not O
gladly O
accept O
it O
as O
a O
welcome O
change O
, O
even O
when O
accompanied O
by O
personal O
risk O
and O
danger O
. O

It O
is O
natural O
for O
health O
and O
strength O
to O
look O
for O
such O
an O
outlet O
, O
and O
in O
the O
time O
in O
which O
Sennoske B-PERSON
lived O
, O
education O
and O
conventional O
usage O
did O
not O
repress O
the O
play O
of O
natural O
energies O
. O

With O
his O
physical O
powers O
developed O
almost O
to O
perfection O
, O
the O
young O
soldier O
actually O
hungered O
for O
an O
opportunity O
where O
his O
harassed O
feelings O
might O
find O
vent O
in O
valorous O
deeds O
. O

The O
very O
thought O
of O
a O
desperate O
hand O
- O
to O
- O
hand O
struggle O
did O
much O
to O
restore O
his O
coolness O
and O
self O
- O
possession O
, O
which O
had O
been O
considerably O
disturbed O
by O
the O
tragic O
scene O
through O
which O
he O
had O
passed O
, O
and O
by O
the O
revelations O
which O
his O
old O
attendant O
had O
made O
to O
him O
. O

As O
they O
came O
to O
the O
room O
where O
he O
now O
knew O
his O
mortal O
enemy O
to O
be O
, O
Sennoske B-PERSON
opened O
the O
sliding O
door O
to O
allow O
the O
servant O
to O
enter O
; O
then O
following O
him O
, O
and O
taking O
the O
platter O
with O
its O
ghastly O
burden O
out O
of O
his O
hand O
, O
he O
deposited O
it O
gently O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
while O
in O
a O
clear O
, O
firm O
, O
and O
perhaps O
slightly O
authoritative O
tone O
he O
said O
: O
“ O
Here O
is O
the O
head O
of O
my O
retainer O
, O
as O
you O
demanded O
it O
; O
I O
now O
ask O
you O
to O
return O
to O
me O
my O
sword O
. O
” O

As O
soon O
as O
he O
entered O
he O
saw O
that O
he O
had O
come O
not O
a O
moment O
too O
soon O
; O
for O
the O
packed O
portmanteaus O
lying O
about O
, O
as O
well O
as O
other O
signs O
, O
showed O
that O
the O
party O
was O
on O
the O
eve O
of O
departure O
. O

Such O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
had O
been O
their O
intention O
; O
it O
was O
only O
the O
knowledge O
that O
a O
number O
of O
Ise B-ORG
samurai O
had O
arrived O
, O
and O
a O
fear O
that O
they O
were O
watched O
and O
would O
not O
in O
a O
body O
be O
able O
to O
decamp O
with O
the O
sword O
in O
their O
possession O
without O
being O
desperately O
opposed O
, O
that O
had O
caused O
the O
delay O
and O
a O
parley O
, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
which O
Sennoske B-PERSON
came O
upon O
them O
. O

All O
of O
them O
, O
and O
their O
leader O
not O
the O
least O
, O
were O
evidently O
considerably O
surprised O
at O
the O
prompt O
and O
literal O
manner O
in O
which O
Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
’s I-PERSON
command O
had O
been O
carried O
out O
. O

The O
Hōjō B-PERSON
chief O
’s O
alternative O
had O
been O
presented O
, O
it O
is O
true O
, O
very O
largely O
out O
of O
spite O
against O
the O
man O
whom O
he O
hated O
, O
because O
that O
man O
had O
scorned O
his O
offers O
and O
eluded O
his O
power O
; O
for O
in O
striking O
at O
Yamagawa B-PERSON
he O
felt O
he O
struck O
at O
Mutto B-PERSON
and O
at O
Mutto B-PERSON
’s O
son O
. O

Yet O
he O
hardly O
expected O
that O
his O
extravagant O
claim O
would O
be O
acceded O
to O
, O
and O
under O
any O
circumstances O
he O
calculated O
upon O
a O
delay O
that O
would O
enable O
him O
to O
escape O
with O
the O
sword O
, O
which O
to O
a O
man O
in O
his O
position O
was O
an O
invaluable O
prize O
. O

In O
the O
event O
of O
his O
being O
unable O
to O
escape O
— O
a O
contingency O
which O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
Ise B-ORG
men O
rendered O
probable O
— O
he O
still O
believed O
it O
would O
be O
possible O
to O
represent O
Sennoske B-PERSON
’s O
loss O
of O
the O
sword O
in O
such O
a O
way O
as O
to O
appeal O
effectually O
to O
the O
prejudices O
of O
the O
extremists O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
sword O
- O
etiquette O
among O
the O
samurai O
travellers O
who O
had O
come O
to O
the O
inn O
. O

He O
thereby O
hoped O
to O
create O
a O
diversion O
and O
to O
make O
the O
whole O
affair O
a O
subject O
of O
negotiation O
, O
during O
which O
time O
he O
would O
have O
possession O
of O
the O
sword O
; O
and O
in O
the O
end O
he O
would O
not O
be O
scrupulous O
in O
framing O
excuses O
and O
contriving O
means O
for O
keeping O
it O
permanently O
. O

Both O
his O
designs O
, O
however O
, O
were O
frustrated O
. O

The O
readiness O
with O
which O
the O
man O
had O
been O
sacrificed O
seemed O
to O
argue O
that O
, O
after O
all O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
what O
his O
young O
master O
had O
said O
, O
no O
very O
high O
value O
was O
attached O
to O
his O
life O
; O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
the O
head O
there O
exposed O
took O
away O
all O
excuse O
for O
keeping O
the O
sword O
any O
longer O
. O

This O
poor O
head O
now O
troubled O
Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
more O
than O
its O
possessor O
had O
ever O
done O
in O
life O
; O
being O
a O
man O
who O
had O
seldom O
been O
thwarted O
, O
he O
would O
have O
given O
much O
to O
draw O
the O
sword O
and O
cut O
the O
now O
inoffensive O
cause O
of O
his O
disappointment O
in O
pieces O
. O

Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
watching O
him O
narrowly O
, O
partly O
divined O
what O
was O
passing O
through O
his O
mind O
, O
and O
regained O
his O
self O
- O
possession O
more O
fully O
as O
the O
other O
showed O
outward O
signs O
of O
anger O
and O
mortification O
. O

He O
again O
repeated O
his O
demand O
, O
but O
with O
a O
stronger O
emphasis O
of O
authority O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
intimate O
that O
he O
had O
means O
to O
enforce O
it O
; O
and O
so O
Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
, O
seeing O
that O
he O
could O
not O
possibly O
frame O
a O
valid O
excuse O
for O
retaining O
the O
weapon O
, O
with O
a O
muttered O
curse O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
handed O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
threw O
it O
over O
to O
his O
enemy O
. O

Sennoske B-PERSON
caught O
it O
; O
and O
as O
he O
found O
, O
with O
his O
accustomed O
grasp O
, O
that O
it O
was O
indeed O
his O
trusty O
blade O
, O
he O
felt O
a O
shock O
which O
caused O
his O
heart O
to O
beat O
almost O
audibly O
as O
it O
seemed O
to O
him O
, O
while O
his O
brain O
seethed O
and O
throbbed O
against O
his O
temples O
with O
the O
tumultuous O
flood O
of O
emotions O
which O
agitated O
it O
. O

But O
this O
excitement O
was O
only O
momentary O
. O

He O
had O
slightly O
bent O
his O
head O
on O
receiving O
the O
weapon O
; O
but O
quickly O
raising O
it O
again O
, O
he O
spoke O
calmly O
and O
clearly O
, O
with O
quiet O
self O
- O
possession O
: O
“ O
You O
have O
given O
me O
back O
my O
sword O
, O
my O
beloved O
samurai O
sword O
; O
but O
the O
mere O
return O
of O
it O
is O
not O
sufficient O
. O

A O
faithful O
and O
dearly O
cherished O
life O
had O
to O
be O
sacrificed O
to O
your O
‘ O
feelings O
of O
honor O
, O
’ O
as O
you O
called O
them O
: O
all O
your O
heads O
must O
accompany O
the O
return O
of O
this O
sword O
to O
satisfy O
my O
feelings O
of O
honor O
! O
” O

He O
had O
drawn O
the O
sword O
as O
he O
concluded O
, O
and O
waited O
with O
chivalrous O
courage O
for O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
until O
at B-CARDINAL
least I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
other O
blade O
should O
be O
bared O
. O

The O
combat O
was O
not O
as O
unequal O
as O
it O
looked O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
sight O
. O

A O
heavy O
Japanese B-NORP
sword O
, O
held O
as O
it O
is O
with O
both O
hands O
, O
and O
not O
admitting O
of O
any O
great O
celerity O
of O
movement O
when O
wielded O
by O
an O
ordinary O
man O
, O
enables O
a O
master O
of O
the O
art O
, O
with O
quickness O
and O
agility O
to O
match O
, O
as O
was O
here O
the O
case O
, O
easily O
to O
keep O
at O
bay O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
or O
even O
three B-CARDINAL
opponents O
. O

Sennoske B-PERSON
had O
placed O
himself O
against O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
room O
; O
his O
foes O
were O
all O
in O
front O
of O
him O
, O
and O
the O
necessity O
of O
requiring O
considerable O
room O
to O
wield O
their O
weapons O
prevented O
them O
from O
overpowering O
him O
by O
too O
many O
rushing O
upon O
him O
at O
once O
. O

Moreover O
, O
they O
were O
at O
a O
disadvantage O
. O

They O
had O
in O
a O
vague O
sort O
of O
way O
expected O
a O
struggle O
of O
some O
kind O
, O
but O
they O
were O
not O
prepared O
for O
this O
sudden O
demonstration O
. O

The O
sound O
of O
muffled O
voices O
and O
footsteps O
in O
the O
hall O
spoke O
of O
a O
reserve O
force O
of O
unknown O
strength O
ready O
to O
assist O
, O
or O
if O
need O
were O
to O
avenge O
, O
the O
young O
champion O
. O

But O
by O
far O
the O
most O
powerful O
influence O
was O
exerted O
by O
the O
flashing O
sword O
before O
them O
. O

It O
was O
not O
like O
other O
swords O
. O

In O
the O
uncertain O
light O
of O
the O
flickering O
candles O
it O
gleamed O
and O
glistened O
with O
a O
wicked O
, O
reddish O
sort O
of O
color O
, O
such O
as O
is O
seen O
in O
newly O
shed O
blood O
. O

It O
cut O
through O
space O
with O
a O
hissing O
, O
seething O
sound O
, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
going O
through O
waves O
, O
not O
of O
air O
, O
but O
of O
water O
or O
blood O
, O
which O
parted O
in O
affright O
before O
its O
sharp O
edge O
. O

As O
it O
was O
raised O
and O
lowered O
, O
it O
looked O
like O
a O
phantom O
snake O
elongating O
and O
contracting O
itself O
at O
will O
. O

All O
the O
dark O
tales O
about O
Muramasa B-PERSON
, O
all O
the O
sinister O
import O
which O
popular O
belief O
attached O
to O
the O
product O
of O
his O
handicraft O
, O
and O
which O
was O
household O
lore O
in O
Japan B-GPE
, O
almost O
found O
justification O
in O
the O
way O
that O
this O
blade O
had O
caused O
the O
death O
of O
Yamagawa B-PERSON
and O
had O
bred O
the O
present O
struggle O
. O

Great O
, O
however O
, O
as O
was O
the O
influence O
of O
such O
thoughts O
and O
feelings O
, O
they O
could O
not O
altogether O
paralyze O
samurai O
instincts O
, O
and O
in O
response O
to O
Sennoske B-PERSON
’s O
challenge O
three B-CARDINAL
blades O
were O
drawn O
almost O
immediately O
. O

With O
a O
motion O
so O
light O
that O
it O
implied O
no O
effort O
, O
the O
young O
soldier O
’s O
weapon O
whizzed O
through O
the O
air O
, O
causing O
the O
head O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
antagonists O
to O
roll O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
and O
in O
its O
downward O
sweep O
striking O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
one O
under O
the O
shoulder O
, O
cutting O
the O
arm O
clean O
off O
. O

It O
was O
the O
work O
of O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
seconds I-TIME
merely O
; O
but O
by O
this O
time O
two B-CARDINAL
more O
of O
the O
party O
, O
among O
whom O
was O
Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
, O
had O
unsheathed O
their O
swords O
. O

The O
Hōjō B-PERSON
chief O
, O
the O
only O
one O
of O
the O
party O
who O
was O
entirely O
free O
from O
the O
influence O
of O
the O
superstitious O
spell O
which O
worked O
upon O
the O
others O
, O
leaped O
forward O
with O
a O
yell O
of O
rage O
as O
he O
saw O
his O
two B-CARDINAL
companions O
fall O
. O

As O
he O
did O
so O
, O
he O
stumbled O
against O
the O
platter O
containing O
Yamagawa B-PERSON
’s O
head O
, O
and O
in O
falling O
, O
the O
point O
of O
his O
sword O
pierced O
his O
knee O
through O
and O
through O
, O
inflicting O
an O
extremely O
painful O
wound O
, O
and O
bringing O
him O
to O
the O
ground O
with O
a O
wail O
of O
anguish O
while O
the O
cry O
of O
his O
onslaught O
was O
yet O
ringing O
through O
the O
room O
. O

He O
lay O
there O
helpless O
, O
his O
fall O
utterly O
demoralizing O
the O
surviving O
men O
- O
at O
- O
arms O
. O

Two B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
took O
no O
active O
part O
whatsoever O
, O
one O
having O
drawn O
his O
sword O
without O
attempting O
to O
use O
it O
; O
while O
the O
other O
had O
not O
even O
done O
as O
much O
, O
but O
had O
remained O
in O
his O
seat O
gazing O
upon O
every O
movement O
of O
Sennoske B-PERSON
’s O
weapon O
with O
a O
stupid O
, O
helpless O
stare O
, O
evidently O
the O
outgrowth O
of O
superstitious O
fears O
. O

The O
remaining O
two B-CARDINAL
who O
still O
stood O
opposed O
to O
the O
young O
champion O
, O
dismayed O
by O
the O
scene O
before O
them O
, O
wielded O
their O
swords O
mechanically O
and O
aimlessly O
, O
and O
seemed O
almost O
to O
rush O
upon O
their O
own O
destruction O
as O
they O
were O
cut O
down O
by O
Sennoske B-PERSON
’s O
blade O
. O

The O
young O
man O
proceeded O
in O
his O
self O
- O
imposed O
task O
almost O
like O
an O
executioner O
carrying O
out O
a O
sentence O
, O
and O
sparing O
none O
. O

Last O
of O
all O
he O
turned O
upon O
Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
having O
drawn O
the O
weapon O
from O
his O
leg O
, O
lay O
writhing O
on O
the O
floor O
in O
transports O
of O
pain O
and O
rage O
, O
making O
wild O
, O
ineffectual O
attempts O
to O
strike O
his O
opponent O
. O

By O
this O
time O
numbers O
of O
the O
visitors O
in O
the O
house O
had O
hurried O
to O
the O
doors O
of O
the O
room O
where O
the O
tragedy O
was O
being O
enacted O
; O
these O
had O
been O
opened O
, O
but O
the O
Ise B-ORG
men O
prevented O
any O
one O
from O
entering O
, O
and O
a O
crowd O
of O
faces O
looked O
in O
upon O
the O
tragic O
spectacle O
. O

Kataki B-ORG
- I-ORG
uchi I-ORG
! O
kataki B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
uchi I-PERSON
! O
resounded O
from O
every O
side O
, O
causing O
all O
within O
ear O
- O
shot O
to O
rush O
to O
the O
spot O
; O
but O
the O
reason O
being O
known O
, O
no O
one O
would O
have O
interfered O
, O
even O
if O
the O
Ise B-ORG
men O
had O
not O
guarded O
the O
entrance O
. O

As O
Sennoske B-PERSON
looked O
at O
the O
man O
writhing O
at O
his O
feet O
, O
he O
thought O
of O
his O
dead O
mother O
, O
of O
his O
father O
’s O
manhood O
blighted O
and O
seared O
by O
foul O
machinations O
, O
and O
of O
his O
faithful O
attendant O
’s O
untimely O
death O
; O
and O
a O
savage O
feeling O
of O
revengeful O
joy O
, O
utterly O
foreign O
to O
his O
brave O
but O
gentle O
nature O
, O
took O
possession O
of O
him O
. O

He O
lowered O
his O
blade O
, O
which O
he O
had O
raised O
already O
, O
and O
addressing O
the O
other O
, O
spoke O
to O
him O
in O
words O
which O
fell O
upon O
his O
ears O
like O
molten O
lead O
injected O
into O
living O
veins O
. O

As O
he O
called O
him O
by O
name O
— O
by O
the O
hated O
name O
of O
Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
, O
than O
which O
none O
was O
more O
execrated O
in O
the O
country O
— O
the O
spectators O
gave O
unmistakable O
signs O
of O
satisfaction O
. O

“ O
It O
is O
small O
honor O
, O
and O
little O
cause O
for O
deserving O
men O
’s O
esteem O
, O
to O
fulfil O
the O
obligations O
of O
kataki B-ORG
- I-ORG
uchi I-ORG
against O
you O
, O
Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
and O
it O
merely O
becomes O
a O
duty O
like O
that O
of O
the O
executioner O
putting O
a O
criminal O
to O
death O
. O

You O
have O
tyrannized O
over O
and O
trampled O
upon O
all O
in O
your O
power O
, O
you O
have O
, O
without O
compunction O
, O
bereft O
them O
of O
possessions O
, O
of O
good O
name O
, O
and O
of O
life O
, O
as O
long O
as O
the O
Hōjō B-PERSON
influence O
gave O
you O
authority O
and O
means O
, O
and O
left O
your O
victims O
without O
redress O
. O

Now O
, O
when O
this O
power O
no O
longer O
shields O
you O
, O
you O
have O
been O
unable O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
assistance O
of O
six B-CARDINAL
stalwart O
men O
- O
at O
- O
arms O
, O
to O
defend O
yourself O
against O
a O
‘ O
boy O
, O
’ O
as O
you O
call O
him O
. O

But O
this O
‘ O
boy O
’ O
is O
strengthened O
and O
inspired O
by O
something O
which O
you O
lack O
, O
and O
which O
you O
think O
of O
no O
value O
. O

He O
fights O
in O
the O
holy O
cause O
of O
right O
and O
of O
a O
just O
retribution O
. O

In O
killing O
you O
I O
restore O
to O
my O
father O
his O
honor O
and O
prestige O
, O
which O
you O
tried O
to O
take O
from O
him O
; O
and O
in O
his O
name O
, O
and O
in O
the O
name O
of O
all O
others O
whom O
you O
have O
unjustly O
accused O
and O
condemned O
, O
I O
hereby O
fulfil O
— O
” O
“ O
Hold O
, O
hold O
! O
” O
interrupted O
the O
doomed O
man O
. O

“ O
Let O
me O
commit O
seppuku O
. O

It O
is O
a O
privilege O
which O
is O
granted O
to O
the O
lowest O
of O
our O
class O
, O
and O
one O
which O
by O
virtue O
of O
my O
rank O
I O
claim O
; O
I O
appeal O
to O
all O
within O
hearing O
to O
see O
that O
it O
is O
granted O
to O
me O
. O
” O

As O
he O
spoke O
, O
his O
voice O
became O
almost O
pleading O
, O
and O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
an O
unmistakable O
sign O
of O
fear O
showed O
itself O
together O
with O
the O
sneering O
malice O
and O
the O
evil O
hate O
of O
which O
the O
face O
still O
spoke O
so O
strongly O
. O

Added O
to O
this O
were O
the O
traces O
of O
physical O
pain O
; O
and O
the O
whole O
effect O
was O
so O
repulsive O
that O
those O
at O
the O
doors O
, O
many O
of O
whom O
were O
no O
strangers O
to O
scenes O
of O
death O
, O
turned O
aside O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
in O
disgust O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
in O
dread O
. O

As O
they O
did O
so O
, O
the O
wretched O
man O
reiterated O
his O
request O
frantically O
, O
without O
giving O
time O
for O
a O
response O
, O
shrieking O
it O
out O
at O
last O
in O
an O
agony O
of O
wild O
terror O
. O

This O
man O
, O
who O
during O
his O
life O
had O
been O
bound O
by O
no O
knightly O
law O
, O
who O
while O
in O
the O
fulness O
of O
health O
had O
remained O
untouched O
alike O
by O
feelings O
of O
veneration O
for O
what O
others O
held O
sacred O
, O
and O
by O
feelings O
of O
dread O
for O
what O
others O
feared O
, O
now O
, O
with O
death O
before O
him O
, O
clung O
desperately O
to O
the O
thought O
of O
dying O
like O
a O
samurai O
. O

He O
had O
known O
scores O
of O
men O
in O
the O
flower O
of O
their O
years B-DATE
die O
in O
such O
a O
way O
serene O
and O
contented O
, O
and O
probably O
the O
thought O
of O
this O
prompted O
his O
demand O
. O

He O
could O
not O
feel O
resigned O
to O
death O
; O
he O
clung O
to O
life O
with O
fierce O
desire O
, O
with O
some O
wild O
hope O
of O
escape O
, O
or O
at O
least O
delay O
, O
from O
the O
doom O
which O
he O
yet O
knew O
to O
be O
inevitable O
. O

“ O
Your O
appeal O
is O
in O
vain O
, O
” O
said O
Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
not O
altogether O
unmoved O
at O
the O
sight O
. O

“ O
Seppuku O
was O
designed O
as O
a O
knightly O
punishment O
for O
samurai O
whose O
errors O
are O
errors O
of O
judgment O
, O
but O
whose O
deeds O
are O
the O
deeds O
of O
samurai O
. O

This O
does O
not O
apply O
to O
you O
, O
who O
have O
ever O
had O
recourse O
to O
intrigue O
, O
to O
circumvention O
and O
low O
cunning O
, O
rather O
than O
to O
arbitration O
by O
the O
sword O
. O

Men O
who O
were O
opposed O
to O
you O
you O
have O
stabbed O
in O
the O
dark O
, O
giving O
them O
no O
opportunity O
to O
defend O
or O
to O
justify O
themselves O
; O
you O
have O
even O
, O
as O
in O
the O
case O
of O
my O
father O
, O
prevented O
them O
from O
finding O
relief O
in O
an O
honorable O
death O
. O

The O
memory O
of O
his O
wrongs O
and O
sufferings O
stands O
between O
us O
, O
and O
steels O
my O
heart O
against O
any O
feelings O
of O
pity O
it O
might O
otherwise O
entertain O
for O
one O
who O
has O
fallen O
as O
low O
as O
you O
have O
. O
” O

As O
Sennoske B-PERSON
spoke O
, O
he O
himself O
experienced O
a O
thrill O
of O
unutterable O
horror O
. O

Without O
volition O
of O
his O
own O
he O
felt O
the O
sword O
in O
his O
hand O
raise O
and O
extend O
itself O
so O
as O
to O
oblige O
him O
to O
hold O
the O
hilt O
as O
firmly O
as O
he O
could O
, O
to O
prevent O
it O
from O
slipping O
out O
of O
his O
grasp O
. O

Was O
it O
merely O
a O
trick O
of O
his O
heated O
fancy O
? O

It O
seemed O
to O
him O
he O
was O
becoming O
unconscious O
. O

All O
the O
incidents O
of O
his O
young O
life O
passed O
before O
him O
in O
review O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
picture O
however O
stood O
out O
in O
bold O
relief O
: O
it O
was O
that O
of O
his O
father O
leaving O
the O
presence O
of O
Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
utterly O
prostrate O
in O
body O
and O
in O
mind O
, O
with O
only O
spirit O
enough O
left O
to O
pray O
that O
, O
impossible O
as O
it O
then O
seemed O
, O
he O
or O
his O
descendants O
might O
yet O
be O
able O
to O
carry O
out O
his O
just O
vengeance O
. O

Sennoske B-PERSON
distinctly O
heard O
the O
prayer O
, O
and O
by O
a O
powerful O
effort O
roused O
himself O
to O
consciousness O
. O

As O
he O
did O
so O
, O
and O
looked O
before O
him O
, O
he O
saw O
the O
head O
of O
Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
, O
severed O
from O
the O
body O
, O
lying O
at O
his O
feet O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
instant O
heard O
a O
low O
murmur O
of O
approbation O
from O
those O
who O
stood O
around O
. O

“ O
I O
hardly O
saw O
your O
sword O
move O
, O
so O
quickly O
you O
did O
it O
, O
” O
said O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
Ise B-ORG
men O
. O

“ O
These O
Muramasas B-GPE
will O
almost O
of O
themselves O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
cut O
off O
a O
man O
’s O
head O
. O
” O

For O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
in O
his O
life O
the O
young O
soldier O
felt O
faint O
and O
weak O
, O
and O
it O
required O
all O
his O
strength O
of O
mind O
and O
will O
to O
complete O
the O
short O
ceremony O
he O
had O
to O
go O
through O
. O

Taking O
the O
head O
of O
Yamagawa B-PERSON
and O
placing O
it O
by O
itself O
on O
the O
raised O
daïs O
at O
one B-CARDINAL
end O
of O
the O
room O
, O
he O
put O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
six B-CARDINAL
retainers O
of O
Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
below O
and O
in O
front O
of O
it O
. O

As O
to O
the O
head O
of O
the O
Hōjō B-PERSON
chief O
, O
he O
placed O
it O
by O
itself O
, O
adding O
a O
small O
piece O
of O
paper O
, O
on O
which O
he O
wrote O
in O
a O
few O
words O
the O
cause O
and O
purport O
of O
this O
kataki O
- O
uchi O
. O

Every O
one O
who O
saw O
it O
would O
thereby O
know O
the O
reason O
of O
this O
vendetta O
; O
and O
the O
gallant O
courage O
with O
which O
the O
deed O
had O
been O
performed O
was O
of O
itself O
sufficient O
to O
convince O
the O
many O
spectators O
of O
the O
justness O
of O
the O
cause O
. O

It O
was O
long B-TIME
past I-TIME
midnight I-TIME
when O
Sennoske B-PERSON
at O
last O
returned O
to O
his O
room O
; O
and O
after O
the O
excitement O
of O
the B-TIME
last I-TIME
few I-TIME
hours I-TIME
he O
found O
that O
sleep O
was O
impossible O
. O

He O
and O
his O
companions O
felt O
it O
a O
relief O
to O
remain O
awake O
and O
confer O
upon O
the O
events O
that O
had O
occurred O
, O
uniting O
them O
in O
a O
general O
way O
with O
that O
inexhaustible O
topic O
of O
conversation O
, O
kataki B-ORG
- I-ORG
uchi I-ORG
. O

Toward O
morning O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
party O
, O
wishing O
that O
their O
brave O
young O
leader O
should O
have O
a O
little O
rest O
, O
proposed O
that O
a O
day B-DATE
’s O
halt O
should O
be O
made O
; O
and O
the O
others O
, O
divining O
his O
reason O
, O
agreed O
to O
it O
. O

Sennoske B-PERSON
strenuously O
objected O
, O
stating O
his O
determination O
to O
start O
with O
the O
dawn O
. O

To O
this O
the O
other O
wilily O
replied O
that O
such O
a O
course O
would O
look O
like O
flight O
, O
and O
might O
be O
called O
such O
by O
any O
of O
Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
’s I-PERSON
supporters O
either O
still O
present O
or O
liable O
to O
arrive O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
. O

Every O
one O
, O
including O
Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
felt O
that O
this O
was O
a O
weak O
reason O
; O
yet O
it O
was O
effectual O
, O
as O
such O
appeals O
often O
are O
when O
good O
arguments O
prove O
unavailing O
. O

It O
was O
determined O
, O
however O
, O
at O
once O
to O
send O
a O
courier O
to O
the O
court O
of O
Kuwana B-GPE
to O
carry O
the O
documents O
and O
despatches O
which O
they O
had O
brought O
with O
them O
from O
Kamakura B-GPE
, O
and O
a O
younger O
member O
of O
the O
party O
immediately O
volunteered O
for O
the O
service O
. O

CHAPTER O
XII O
. O

Mutto B-PERSON
, O
after O
the O
departure O
of O
Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
continued O
the O
same O
quiet O
, O
uneventful O
life O
that O
he O
had O
led O
for O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

He O
was O
perhaps O
even O
a O
little O
more O
reserved O
than O
before O
, O
if O
that O
were O
possible O
, O
and O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
glorious O
news O
arriving O
day B-DATE
after O
day O
frequently O
making O
mention O
of O
his O
son O
’s O
gallantry O
and O
bold O
deeds O
, O
the O
gloom O
on O
his O
countenance O
seemed O
to O
be O
as O
firmly O
fixed O
as O
ever O
. O

Two B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
times O
he O
called O
at O
the O
smith O
’s O
, O
and O
these O
were O
the O
only O
occasions O
when O
, O
listening O
to O
O O
Tetsu B-ORG
’s O
merry O
talk O
, O
he O
showed O
something O
like O
interest O
in O
passing O
events O
and O
a O
partial O
forgetfulness O
of O
the O
grief O
which O
weighed O
on O
him O
. O

His O
duties O
at O
the O
court O
— O
now O
that O
the O
number O
of O
retainers O
was O
limited O
— O
had O
become O
more O
onerous O
, O
and O
he O
was O
almost O
constantly O
in O
attendance O
. O

One B-TIME
morning I-TIME
he O
was O
there O
as O
usual O
, O
making O
a O
report O
of O
what O
had O
occurred O
, O
when O
a O
courier O
arrived O
and O
was O
ushered O
in O
. O

This O
man O
, O
who O
was O
almost O
breathless O
, O
with O
every O
sign O
of O
exhaustion O
, O
was O
he O
who O
had O
been O
despatched O
by O
Sennoske B-PERSON
; O
and O
it O
happened O
that O
he O
was O
also O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
to O
bring O
authentic O
news O
of O
the O
fall O
of O
Kamakura B-GPE
and O
of O
the O
complete O
overthrow O
and O
annihilation O
of O
the O
Hōjō B-PERSON
power O
. O

He O
delivered O
his O
letters O
, O
and O
the O
joyful O
tidings O
at O
once O
spread O
through O
the O
castle O
and O
into O
the O
town O
. O

The O
Duke B-ORG
, O
learning O
that O
the O
courier O
had O
himself O
participated O
in O
the O
fight O
, O
ordered O
refreshments O
brought O
in O
, O
of O
which O
he O
caused O
him O
to O
partake O
while O
the O
despatches O
were O
being O
read O
. O

When O
the O
reading O
had O
been O
concluded O
, O
the O
rich O
wine O
and O
generous O
fare O
, O
and O
still O
more O
perhaps O
the O
absorbing O
attention O
which O
was O
paid O
to O
the O
recital O
, O
invigorated O
the O
new O
- O
comer O
, O
who O
forthwith O
gave O
a O
graphic O
account O
of O
the O
battle O
. O

From O
general O
outlines O
he O
soon O
passed O
on O
to O
particulars O
, O
which O
he O
knew O
would O
be O
welcome O
, O
speaking O
of O
the O
way O
the O
Ise B-ORG
men O
had O
distinguished O
themselves O
, O
and O
giving O
the O
names O
of O
those O
who O
had O
won O
special O
renown O
. O

None O
, O
however O
, O
stood O
as O
high O
as O
Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
saved O
the O
life O
of O
Nitta B-ORG
, O
the O
commander O
- O
in O
- O
chief O
, O
during O
the O
hottest O
part O
of O
the O
fray O
, O
who O
seemed O
invulnerable O
, O
and O
whose O
exploits O
had O
made O
him O
and O
his O
sword O
an O
object O
of O
superstitious O
terror O
to O
the O
enemy O
. O

The O
courier O
went O
on O
to O
speak O
of O
the O
command O
which O
had O
been O
intrusted O
to O
the O
young O
hero O
, O
and O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
was O
now O
on O
his O
way O
home O
, O
having O
been O
detained O
only O
temporarily O
by O
a O
difficulty O
with O
Nagasaki B-GPE
no O
Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
, O
the O
noted O
Hōjō B-PERSON
partisan O
, O
whom O
, O
together O
with O
six B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
retainers O
, O
he O
had O
attacked O
and O
killed O
single O
- O
handed O
. O

When O
the O
courier O
reached O
this O
part O
of O
the O
narrative O
a O
heavy O
fall O
was O
heard O
; O
and O
on O
looking O
round O
it O
was O
found O
that O
Mutto B-PERSON
had O
fainted O
, O
and O
in O
falling O
had O
struck O
his O
head O
against O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
wooden O
pillars O
. O

Assistance O
was O
immediately O
rendered O
him O
; O
but O
although O
the O
contusion O
was O
very O
slight O
, O
it O
was O
hours B-TIME
before O
he O
recovered O
. O

Then O
his O
face O
showed O
a O
remarkable O
change O
. O

There O
was O
no O
trace O
left O
on O
it O
of O
bitterness O
, O
of O
gloom O
, O
or O
of O
dejection O
, O
and O
it O
bore O
a O
look O
of O
complete O
though O
subdued O
content O
. O

He O
now O
told O
the O
secret O
of O
his O
life O
to O
the O
Duke O
, O
who O
did O
not O
stint O
himself O
in O
expressions O
of O
sincere O
and O
heartfelt O
congratulation O
. O

To O
show O
how O
very O
much O
in O
earnest O
he O
was O
, O
he O
on O
the B-DATE
same I-DATE
day I-DATE
made O
Mutto B-PERSON
his O
hereditary O
karo B-PERSON
— O
which O
was O
the O
highest O
acknowledgment O
of O
his O
esteem O
and O
trust O
that O
he O
could O
show O
him O
. O

It O
was O
an O
honor O
which O
the O
recipient O
for O
his O
own O
sake O
alone O
would O
have O
waived O
, O
but O
which O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
his O
son O
he O
felt O
himself O
bound O
to O
accept O
. O

Two B-DATE
days I-DATE
later I-DATE
Sennoske B-PERSON
arrived O
at O
Kuwana B-GPE
with O
his O
party O
. O

His O
reception O
would O
have O
turned O
the O
head O
of O
any O
one O
with O
less O
modesty O
than O
had O
fallen O
to O
the O
young O
warrior O
’s O
share O
. O

His O
passion O
for O
O O
Tetsu O
also O
acted O
as O
an O
efficient O
counter O
- O
influence O
in O
repressing O
his O
vanity O
. O

He O
could O
not O
but O
feel O
gratified O
at O
the O
honors O
shown O
to O
him O
— O
honors O
such O
as O
were O
seldom O
accorded O
to O
one O
so O
young O
; O
yet O
his O
principal O
care O
being O
always O
of O
her O
and O
of O
what O
she O
thought O
of O
him O
, O
every O
other O
opinion O
as O
to O
his O
deeds O
, O
however O
flattering O
it O
might O
be O
, O
became O
by O
comparison O
less O
important O
and O
less O
valuable O
. O

The O
only O
time O
when O
this O
feeling O
was O
in O
abeyance O
was O
during O
his O
interview O
with O
his O
father O
. O

Sennoske B-PERSON
had O
reached O
the O
castle O
a B-TIME
little I-TIME
past I-TIME
noon I-TIME
, O
and O
had O
immediately O
been O
ushered O
into O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
Duke O
, O
where O
he O
had O
been O
detained O
for O
several B-TIME
hours I-TIME
, O
giving O
a O
minute O
account O
of O
the O
events O
of O
the O
campaign O
. O

With O
his O
father O
, O
whose O
altered O
appearance O
filled O
him O
with O
delight O
, O
he O
had O
been O
able O
to O
exchange O
only O
a O
few O
words O
while O
being O
conducted O
to O
the O
reception O
- O
hall O
. O

When O
he O
left O
there O
he O
was O
besieged O
by O
persons O
attached O
to O
the O
court O
, O
inquiring O
after O
relatives O
and O
friends O
. O

He O
was O
too O
kind O
- O
hearted O
not O
to O
stop O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
his O
impatience O
, O
when O
with O
a O
few O
words O
he O
was O
able O
either O
to O
give O
assurance O
of O
an O
absent O
dear O
one O
’s O
safety O
, O
or O
to O
speak O
of O
the O
bravery O
and O
martial O
spirit O
of O
a O
departed O
one O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
no O
samurai O
wife O
or O
mother O
could O
look O
upon O
the O
loss O
otherwise O
than O
with O
feelings O
of O
pride O
and O
satisfaction O
. O

It O
was O
nearly B-TIME
evening I-TIME
when O
he O
found O
himself O
alone O
with O
his O
father O
in O
the O
old O
house O
. O

As O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
men O
stood O
facing O
each O
other O
, O
excess O
of O
emotion O
for O
a O
while O
prevented O
both O
from O
giving O
vent O
to O
their O
feelings O
in O
words O
. O

Mutto B-PERSON
finally O
put O
his O
hand O
on O
the O
other O
’s O
shoulder O
, O
saying O
in O
tones O
of O
deep O
affection O
: O
“ O
I O
owe O
it O
to O
you O
, O
my O
son O
, O
that O
I O
can O
again O
enjoy O
this O
beautiful O
world O
, O
the O
glorious O
sun O
, O
the O
fruitful O
earth O
, O
and O
all O
the O
bright O
scenes O
it O
shows O
to O
us O
. O

I O
owe O
it O
to O
you O
that O
I O
am O
at O
peace O
with O
myself O
, O
and O
that O
I O
can O
lie O
down O
at O
night B-TIME
thinking O
of O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
not O
with O
morose O
gloom O
as O
of O
a O
dreary O
task O
, O
but O
with O
glad O
content O
. O

I O
owe O
it O
to O
you O
that O
death O
has O
now O
no O
terrors O
for O
me O
, O
and O
that O
I O
can O
leave O
the O
world O
without O
the O
maddening O
thought O
that O
he O
who O
brought O
destruction O
upon O
my O
lord O
and O
benefactor O
remains O
in O
it O
, O
glorying O
in O
the O
ruin O
he O
wrought O
, O
and O
mocking O
at O
the O
samurai O
who O
is O
unable O
to O
bring O
him O
to O
justice O
. O

He O
has O
perished O
— O
perished O
by O
your O
hands O
, O
knowing O
that O
it O
was O
a O
son O
of O
mine O
who O
slew O
him O
; O
and O
the O
name O
of O
Numa B-PERSON
will O
stand O
in O
the O
samurai O
annals O
without O
a O
blot O
on O
its O
escutcheon O
, O
for O
I O
know O
of O
no O
wrong O
I O
have O
committed O
save O
this O
forced O
omission O
of O
my O
duty O
. O

You O
have O
given O
me O
back O
my O
peace O
of O
mind O
, O
and O
with O
it O
life O
, O
health O
, O
and O
happy O
content O
such O
as O
I O
never O
again O
thought O
to O
enjoy O
. O
” O

The O
tears O
sprang O
to O
Sennoske B-PERSON
’s O
eyes O
as O
his O
father O
thus O
addressed O
him O
. O

The O
stern O
, O
sad O
man O
, O
who O
had O
never O
before O
unbent O
himself O
, O
and O
whom O
in O
spite O
of O
a O
deep O
feeling O
of O
awe O
he O
had O
always O
loved O
with O
intense O
affection O
, O
now O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
spoke O
to O
him O
with O
words O
of O
tender O
emotion O
. O

Even O
the O
voice O
was O
changed O
; O
and O
its O
sound O
fell O
upon O
him O
with O
a O
soft O
, O
tender O
cadence O
, O
as O
unlike O
his O
father O
’s O
former O
tones O
as O
the O
expressions O
which O
moved O
him O
so O
deeply O
differed O
from O
the O
methodical O
, O
impressive O
speeches O
that O
he O
had O
previously O
been O
accustomed O
to O
hear O
. O

It O
was O
like O
a O
change O
from O
the O
northern O
April B-DATE
wind O
, O
with O
its O
sad O
, O
moaning O
sound O
, O
to O
the O
pleasant O
May O
breeze O
, O
stirring O
grasses O
and O
leaves O
into O
gentle O
melody O
. O

“ O
I O
am O
indeed O
blessed O
and O
favored O
by O
fortune O
, O
” O
the O
young O
soldier O
replied O
, O
“ O
that O
I O
have O
been O
able O
to O
do O
my O
simple O
duty O
in O
such O
a O
manner O
as O
to O
cause O
you O
to O
think O
me O
worthy O
thus O
to O
be O
addressed O
by O
you O
. O

If O
this O
arm O
could O
fulfil O
its O
task O
, O
it O
was O
because O
it O
acquired O
skill O
from O
your O
teaching O
and O
was O
exerted O
in O
a O
righteous O
cause O

From O
the O
way O
in O
which O

been O
ordained O

” O

Sennoske B-PERSON
then O
gave O
an O
account O
of O
the O
whole O
scene O
as O
it O
occurred O
; O
and O
in O
return O
his O
father O
imparted O
to O
him O
all O
the O
particulars O
preceding O
his O
own O
departure O
from O
the O
province O
of O
Mutsu B-GPE
. O

An B-TIME
hour I-TIME
or O
two B-CARDINAL
was O
thus O
spent O
before O
either O
of O
them O
was O
aware O
of O
the O
lapse O
of O
time O
, O
and O
then O
the O
young O
man O
, O
in O
reply O
to O
the O
repeated O
congratulations O
of O
his O
parent O
, O
added O
: O
“ O
I O
was O
armed O
, O
moreover O
, O
with O
a O
matchless O
sword O
, O
that O
of O
itself O
would O
almost O
be O
sufficient O
to O
give O
confidence O
even O
to O
a O
weakling O
, O
and O
enable O
him O
to O
achieve O
success O
. O

Muramasa B-PERSON
’s O
gift O
has O
indeed O
been O
inestimable O
, O
and O
, O
next O
to O
you O
, O
my O
best O
thanks O
are O
due O
to O
him O
. O
” O

As O
Sennoske B-PERSON
spoke O
, O
his O
mind O
reverted O
less O
to O
the O
smith B-PERSON
than O
to O
the O
pretty O
O O
Tetsu O
, O
and O
an O
involuntary O
tinge O
of O
color O
flushed O
his O
cheek O
. O

Mutto B-PERSON
divined O
the O
drift O
of O
his O
son O
’s O
thoughts O
, O
and O
not O
unwilling O
to O
be O
left O
alone O
for O
a O
while O
with O
his O
own O
emotion O
, O
he O
replied O
as O
if O
in O
answer O
to O
an O
unspoken O
question O
: O
“ O
You O
certainly O
owe O
a O
great O
debt O
of O
gratitude O
to O
Muramasa B-PERSON
, O
and O
you O
ought O
not O
to O
delay O
thanking O
him O
. O

It O
would O
be O
an O
inexcusable O
negligence O
and O
a O
breach O
of O
etiquette O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
sign O
of O
ingratitude O
, O
not O
to O
visit O
him O
on O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
day I-DATE
of O
your O
arrival O
. O

You O
will O
of O
course O
also O
see O
O O
Tetsu O
, O
” O
he O
added O
, O
with O
something O
of O
a O
smile O
on O
his O
face O
as O
Sennoske B-PERSON
expressed O
his O
readiness O
at O
once O
to O
act O
upon O
the O
suggestion O
. O

“ O
Muramasa B-PERSON
and O
myself O
have O
made O
arrangements O
lately O
; O
and O
if O
you O
are O
still O
of O
the O
same O
mind O
as O
regards O
the O
girl O
, O
your O
marriage O
may O
take O
place O
at O
once O
, O
before O
you O
start O
on O
your O
new O
mission O
to O
Idzu B-PRODUCT
. O
” O

There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
picture O
the O
meeting O
of O
the O
lovers O
. O

This O
narrative O
has O
been O
told O
to O
little O
purpose O
if O
the O
reader O
’s O
imagination O
can O
not O
readily O
divine O
the O
scene O
. O

Sennoske B-PERSON
was O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
flush O
of O
a O
healthy O
, O
vigorous O
young O
manhood O
, O
and O
his O
intellect O
, O
which O
was O
of O
a O
very O
high O
order O
both O
by O
nature O
and O
education O
, O
found O
in O
his O
love O
for O
O O
Tetsu O
an O
outlet O
for O
its O
natural O
craving O
after O
something O
higher O
and O
nobler O
than O
the O
mere O
physical O
duties O
of O
a O
soldier O
. O

The O
girl O
, O
who O
had O
also O
inherited O
health O
and O
strength O
and O
an O
ardent O
, O
excitable O
temperament O
, O
had O
consoled O
herself O
for O
her O
lonely O
, O
companionless O
life O
with O
thoughts O
of O
him O
who O
was O
ever O
in O
her O
mind O
. O

With O
both O
it O
was O
a O
great O
passion O
pervading O
every O
part O
of O
their O
nature O
, O
ennobled O
and O
sanctified O
by O
the O
purity O
and O
innocence O
of O
their O
lives O
, O
and O
receiving O
strength O
and O
depth O
beyond O
the O
ken O
of O
ordinary O
beings O
by O
their O
pure O
, O
ardent O
singleness O
of O
purpose O
. O

Sennoske B-PERSON
’s O
meeting O
with O
Muramasa B-PERSON
at O
first B-ORDINAL
hardly O
satisfied O
him O
. O

In O
spite O
of O
the O
comparatively O
short O
time O
which O
had O
elapsed O
since O
his O
departure O
, O
he O
found O
the O
smith O
considerably O
wasted O
, O
with O
black O
rings O
round O
the O
eyes O
, O
even O
more O
restless O
and O
nervous O
than O
formerly O
, O
and O
evidently O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
acute O
mental O
troubles O
and O
anxiety O
. O

The O
young O
soldier O
’s O
fervent O
thanks O
for O
the O
sword O
, O
with O
which O
he O
opened O
the O
conversation O
, O

were O
listened O
to O
without O
any O
show O
of O
interest O
, O
and O
even O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
strong O
impatience O
which O
seemed O
to O
have O
taken O
possession O
of O
the O
man O
’s O
nature O
. O

This O
, O
however O
, O
was O
considerably O
modified O
when O
Sennoske B-PERSON
came O
to O
speak O
of O
the O
exploits O
with O
which O
his O
name O
had O
been O
connected O
, O
modestly O
describing O
them O
as O
being O
due O
principally O
to O
the O
marvellous O
powers O
of O
his O
blade O
; O
and O
perceiving O
the O
effect O
of O
his O
words O
, O
he O
dilated O
at O
length O
upon O
all O
its O
points O
of O
proven O
excellence O
. O

When O
at O
last O
he O
paused O
, O
the O
smith O
, O
after O
a O
few O
short O
words O
of O
congratulation O
, O
asked O
him O
abruptly O
: O
“ O
Do O
you O
know O
of O
any O
Masamune B-ORG
swords O
being O
used O
in O
this O
campaign O
? O
” O

“ O
There O
were O
only B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
, O
or O
at O
most B-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
, O
such O
blades O
in O
the O
possession O
of O
our O
troops O
, O
” O
was O
the O
reply O
; O
“ O
but O
among O
the O
Hōjō B-PERSON
adherents O
there O
were O
ten B-CARDINAL
or O
twelve B-CARDINAL
. O

I O
myself O
have O
taken O
one O
, O
richly O
ornamented O
, O
which O
was O
formerly O
in O
the O
possession O
of O
Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
; O
if O
you O
attach O
any O
value O
to O
it O
, O
I O
should O
be O
happy O
if O
you O
would O
allow O
me O
to O
offer O
it O
to O
you O
. O
” O

“ O
Beware O
of O
what O
you O
say O
! O
” O
hissed O
rather O
than O
spoke O
Muramasa B-PERSON
, O
evidently O
under O
great O
excitement O
. O

“ O
Would O
you O
discard O
the O
superior O
weapon O
, O
and O
keep O
the O
inferior O
? O

You O
must O
surely O
know O
that O
it O
is O
reported O
that O
now O
in O
his O
old O
age O
Masamune B-PERSON
, O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
my O
former O
masters O
, O
forges O
swords O
which O
far O
exceed O
mine O
in O
excellence O
. O
” O

“ O
That O
is O
impossible O
, O
” O
Sennoske B-PERSON
replied O
, O
his O
tone O
and O
manner O
attesting O
his O
truthfulness O
and O
showing O
that O
he O
was O
scarcely O
less O
in O
earnest O
than O
the O
other O
. O

“ O
Besides O
, O
if O
proof O
to O
the O
contrary O
were O
necessary O
, O
have O
I O
not O
given O
it O
? O

Could O
a O
mere O
youth O
like O
myself O
come O
out O
unscathed O
and O
victorious O
in O
a O
struggle O
against O
seven B-CARDINAL
veterans O
, O
whose O
chief O
wielded O
a O
Masamune B-ORG
blade O
, O
if O
mine O
had O
not O
been O
superior O
to O
his O
, O
and O
, O
I O
may O
say O
, O
to O
all O
the O
others O
as O
well O
? O
” O

“ O
So O
it O
was O
this O
Masamune B-ORG
blade O
which O
Taka B-PERSON
Suke I-PERSON
had O
in O
his O
hands O
when O
you O
killed O
him O
and O
his O
pack O
of O
retainers O
? O
” O

the O
smith B-PERSON
said O
, O
while O
a O
fierce O
joy O
lit O
up O
his O
sunken O
eyes O
. O

“ O
The O
sword O
is O
the O
soul O
of O
the O
samurai O
, O
and O
it O
imparts O
its O
nature O

him O
who O
wears O
it O

I O
knew O
that O
that O

could O
never O

to O
a O

those O
qualities O

EPILOGUE B-ORG

Sennoske B-PERSON
and O
his O
fair O
wife O
enjoyed O
a O
lifetime O
of O
good O
fortune O

Nothing O
untoward O
befell O
them O
but O
such O
small O
ills O
as O
humanity O
can O
never O
be O
entirely O
free O
from O
; O
and O
these O
were O
scarcely O

in O
their O
happy O

in O
the O
love O

they O
bore O
to O

to O
the O
children O
that O

them O

The O
smith B-PERSON

son O

in O
his O
profession O
; O

the O
blades O
he O
forged O
, O
although O
of O
higher O
quality O
than O
those O
of O
other O
smiths O
, O
were O
not O
prized O
as O
those O
of O
his O
father O
. O

They O
were O
like O
them O
in O
appearance O

in O
form O
, O
and O
in O
sharpness O
, O
and O
merely O
looking O
at O
the O
one O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
other O
, O
it O
was O
often O
impossible O
to O
tell O
them O
apart O

in O
a O
few O
public O
trials O
that O
had O
been O
made O
they O
proved O
of O
equal O

in O
all O

strength O
; O

in O
fine O
fancy O

such O
as O
cutting O

piece O

paper O
, O
which O
is O
one O
of O
the O
crowning O
tests O
of O
the O
original O
Muramasa B-PERSON

they O
were O
a O
shade O
inferior O

lacking O
in O
a O
nameless O
something O
, O
which O
could O
not O
be O
described O
in O
words O
, O
but O
which O
an O
expert O
could O
tell O
at O
once O
when O

In O
short O
, O
they O
were O
not O
true O

A O
few O

of O
these O
competitive O

were O
made O
, O
however O
, O
and O
in O
Kuwana B-GPE
at O

they O
were O
soon O
prohibited O

for O
they O
always O
ended O
in O
heated O
discussions O
and O
bloodshed O
between O
the O
contending O
parties O
. O

As O
a O
singular O
testimony O
to O
the O
value O
of O
the O
older O
weapon O
, O
it O
was O
noticed O
that O
its O
possessor O
nearly O
always O
came O
off O
victorious O

The O
victory O
of O
Nitta B-ORG

although O

establishing O
the O
Mikado B-ORG

divine O
rights O

unfortunately O
did O
not O
secure O
peace O

the O
Empire B-GPE

The O
claims O

of O

who O
had O
taken O
upon O
themselves O
the O
risk O

overthrowing O

Rival O
jealousies O

public O

feuds O
, O
again O
reigned O
supreme O

precipitated O
civil O

deluged O
the O
country O

Only O
the O

were O
respected O

held O
sacred O

alike O

continued O
up O

the O
reign O
of O
Iyeyas B-ORDINAL

two B-DATE
hundred I-DATE

fifty I-DATE

which O
inaugurated O
the O
long O
peace O
that O
has O
since O
ruled O
in O
the O
Empire B-GPE

During O
all O
this O
time O
the O
position O

in O
possession O

the O
family O
flourished O

succeeded O
, O
knowing O
hardly O
any O
reverses O
of O
fortune O
. O

But O
, O
strange O
as O
it O
may O
appear O
, O
with O
the O
beginning O
of O
this O
peace O
the O
fortunes O
of O
the O
house O
of O
Numa B-PERSON
declined O
. O

Some O
inexplicable O
bond O
seemed O
to O
connect O
their O
welfare O
with O
the O
fate O
of O
Muramasa B-PERSON
’s O
swords O
. O

These O
swords O
, O
as O
long O
as O
strife O
and O
bloodshed O
were O
rife O
, O
were O
more O
esteemed O
than O
those O
of O
any O
other O
maker O
, O
in O
spite O
, O
or O
perhaps O
partly O
on O
account O
, O
of O
the O
constantly O
growing O
feelings O
of O
superstition O
with O
which O
they O
were O
regarded O
. O

Their O
possessors O
somehow O
or O
other O
never O
seemed O
content O
unless O
they O
had O
an O
opportunity O
for O
using O
them O
; O
and O
so O
generally O
did O
they O
succeed O
in O
gaining O
the O
victory O
over O
their O
opponents O
that O
at O
last O
even O
the O
bravest O
shrank O
with O
dread O
from O
fighting O
a O
duel O
with O
a O
man O
armed O
with O
a O
Muramasa B-PERSON

Moreover O
, O
they O
were O
a O
fruitful O
cause O
of O
accidents O

Often O
, O
when O
an O
interval O
of O
peace O
which O
had O
lasted O
for O
fifteen B-DATE
or I-DATE
twenty I-DATE
years I-DATE
had O
caused O
such O
a O
sword O
to O
remain O
unused O
for O
that O
time O
, O
upon O
first B-ORDINAL
being O
drawn O
it O
brought O
about O

dire O
calamity O

It O
was O
a O
common O
thing O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
every O
care O
being O
taken O
, O
for O
the O
blade O
to O
fall O
out O
in O
some O
unaccountable O
way O
and O
strike O
the O
wearer O
, O
inflicting O
a O
fatal O
wound O
. O

Among O
those O
who O
suffered O
in O
this O
way O
were O
some O
of O
Numa B-PERSON
’s O
descendants O
. O

These O
, O
however O
, O
were O
almost O
the O
only O
misfortunes O
which O
overtook O
them O
. O

With O
the O
return O
of O
peace O
these O
casualties O
increased O
to O
such O
an O
alarming O
extent O
that O
at O
last O
the O
Shôgun O
’s O
government O
issued O
a O
peremptory O
order O
, O
forbidding O
the O
use O
of O
these O
swords O
throughout O
the O
entire O
country O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
they O
were O
still O
prized O
in O
private O
; O
but O
the O
power O
of O
the O
Tokugawa B-ORG
’s O
rule O
was O
too O
strong O
and O
the O
edict O
too O
imperative O
to O
allow O
of O
its O
being O
in O
any O
way O
openly O
disregarded O
. O

Muramasa B-PERSON
blades O
after O
this O
were O
found O
mostly O
with O
a O
few O
of O
the O
most O
noted O
ronins O
and O
robbers O
, O
whom O
tradition O
speaks O
of O
as O
having O
been O
wonderfully O
successful O
. O

An O
unfortunate O
affair O
of O
honor O
which O
happened O
just B-DATE
thirteen I-DATE
years I-DATE
after O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
long O
peace O
, O
and O
in O
which O
the O
then O
karo B-ORG
of O
the O
Duke O
of O
Kuwana B-GPE
, O
a O
descendant O
of O
Sennoske B-PERSON
, O
slew O
his O
master O
’s O
son O
by O
mistake O
, O
forced O
him O
to O
commit O
seppuku O
. O

In O
consideration O
of O
their O
illustrious O
and O
faithful O
services O
, O
the O
reigning O
Duke B-PERSON
caused O
the O
family O
of O
the O
unfortunate O
man O
to O
suffer O
no O
further O
punishment O
than O
banishment O
from O
his O
province O
. O

They O
found O
an O
asylum O
with O
the O
neighboring O
Duke O
of O
Todo O
, O
who O
also O
gave O
to O
the O
oldest O
son O
, O
who O
was O
approaching O
man O
’s O
estate O
, O
a O
position O
at O
his O
court O
which O
, O
although O
far O
inferior O
to O
that O
which O
his O
father O
had O
held O
at O
Kuwana B-GPE
, O
was O
yet O
a O
high O
and O
an O
honorable O
one O
. O

This O
office O
was O
made O
hereditary O
with O
his O
descendants O
, O
who O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
faithful O
services O
, O
failed O
to O
improve O
it O
. O

The O
genius O
of O
the O
family O
evidently O
lay O
in O
a O
military O
direction O
; O
and O
although O
now O
and O
then O
some O
one O
of O
its O
members O
would O
perform O
a O
great O
deed O
of O
arms O
, O
opportunities O
for O
such O
deeds O
were O
rare O
, O
and O
the O
family O
barely O
succeeded O
in O
retaining O
their O
new O
position O
: O
this O
, O
however O
, O
they O
did O
as O
long O
as O
old O
Japan B-GPE
existed O
. O

But O
the O
end O
of O
the O
power O
of O
the O
sword O
was O
rapidly O
approaching O
. O

In O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
year I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
period I-DATE
of O
Ansei B-PERSON
( O
1855 B-DATE
) O
came O
the O
establishment O
of O
treaties O
with O
foreign O
nations O
, O
and O
this O
sounded O
the O
death O
- O
knell O
of O
feudalism O
in O
Japan B-GPE
. O

For O
a O
time O
the O
descendants O
of O
Sennoske B-PERSON
still O
subsisted O
upon O
a O
scanty O
allowance O
as O
dependants O
of O
the O
Duke O
of O
Todo O
. O

The O
complete O
abolition O
of O
feudalism O
by O
imperial O
decree O
in O
the B-DATE
third I-DATE
year I-DATE
of I-DATE
Meiji I-DATE
( O
1870 B-DATE

completed O
their O
ruin O

On O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
day I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
tenth I-DATE
month I-DATE
of I-DATE
that I-DATE
year I-DATE
there O
was O
breathless O
excitement O
in O
the O
town O
. O

All O
the O
samurai O
of O
any O
standing O
were O
convened O
by O
the O
Duke B-ORG
in O
the O
large O
hall O
of O
the O
palace O
; O
and O
there O
an O
imperial O
envoy O
, O
who O
had O
arrived O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
before I-DATE
, O
read O
the O
decree O
, O
that O
from O
that B-DATE
day I-DATE
feudalism O
ceased O
to O
exist O
. O

“ O
Everything O
is O
at O
an O
end O
, O
” O
some O
of O
the O
samurai O
, O
stupefied O
by O
the O
news O
, O
said O
as O
they O
passed O
out O
of O
the O
hall O
; O
and O
so O
to O
a O
great O
extent O
it O
was O
. O

At O
an O
end O
all O
their O
inherited O
and O

The O

with O
which O
birth O

had O
endowed O
them O
— O
all O
this O
in O
one B-DATE
day I-DATE
had O
become O
like O
a O
threadbare O
garment O
, O
fit O
only O
to O
be O
thrown O
away O
; O
while O
scarcely O
one O
of O
the O
losers O
had O
the O

possessed O
the O
faculty O
of O

Without O

to O
the O

of O

, O
the O
last O
of O
the O
line O
of O
Sennoske B-PERSON
found O
himself O
in O
a O
sad O
condition O
. O

The O
miserable O
pension O
allowed O
him O
by O
government O
was O
inadequate O
to O
his O
barest O
needs O
; O
but O
even O
this O
was O
soon O
lost O
to O
him O
, O
and O
the O
accomplishments O
of O
peace O
having O
never O
been O
his O
, O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
care O
for O
himself O
. O

Fortune O
befriended O
him O
no O
more O
; O
those O
in O
places O
of O
official O
power O
and O
affluence O
no O
longer O
reverenced O
the O
rank O
of O
samurai O
, O
but O
turned O
him O
from O
their O
doors O
, O
and O
he O
sank O
lower O
and O
lower O
in O
the O
social O
scale O
, O
until O
only O
the O
most O
degrading O
position O
of O
all O

that O
of O
the O
poor O

So O
to O

he O
lives O

a O
