Extract O
from O
letter O
dated O
February B-DATE

, O
from O
Oliver B-PERSON
Robertson I-PERSON

banker O
of O

to O

. O

we O
got O
into O
a O
pretty O
hot O
argument O
over O
it O
, O
too O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
I O
thought O
Morrison B-PERSON
was O
kidding O
me O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
; O
but O
he O
kept O
insisting O
that O
Murdock B-PERSON
would O
n’t O
have O
done O
such O
a O
thing O
if O
he O
really O
had O
n’t O
meant O
it O
for O
the O
truth O
. O

I O
told O
him O
that O
Murdock B-PERSON
had O
probably O
had O
his O
little O
secret O
hobby O
of O
fiction O
- O
writing O
unknown O
to O
any O
of O
his O
friends O
, O
that O
he O
had O
thought O
up O
this O
story O
for O
his O
own O
entertainment O
, O
and O
had O
taken O
this O
means O
of O
making O
it O
“ O
plausible O
. O
” O

I O
admit O
I O
do O
n’t O
understand O
why O
he O
should O
want O
to O
do O
such O
a O
thing O
, O
but O
I O
think O
you O
will O
agree O
with O
me O
that O
at O
least O
it O
is O
very O
clever O
. O

You O
can O
never O
tell O
what O
these O
serious O
- O
minded O
, O
middle O
- O
aged O
bachelors O
are O
going O
to O
do O
next O
. O

I O
was O
really O
quite O
exasperated O
at O
Morrison B-ORG
for O
believing O
this O
story O
. O

He O
knew O
poor O
Stanley B-ORG
better O
than O
I O
, O
it O
is O
true O
; O
but O
as O
joint O
executor O
of O
the O
estate O
, O
I O
insisted O
that O
if O
it O
were O
to O
be O
published O
at O
all O
, O
it O
should O
be O
as O
fiction O
, O
pure O
and O
simple O
. O

Then O
, O
if O
anyone O
wants O
to O
believe O
it O
, O
let O
him O
go O
to O
it O
. O

Morrison B-PERSON
argued O
that O
the O
notarial O
seal O
and O
the O
definite O
instructions O
on O
the O
envelope O
showed O
Murdock B-PERSON
meant O
business O
-- O
that O
he O
was O
n’t O
the O
kind O
to O
clutter O
up O
a O
strong O
box O
with O
junk O
. O

He O
reminded O
me O
that O
Murdock B-PERSON
had O
chucked O
a O
fine O
position O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
to O
come O
to O
India B-GPE
on O
a O
smaller O
salary O
and O
in O
a O
technically O
inferior O
rating O
, O
which O
was O
a O
fair O
indication O
of O
the O
truth O
of O
his O
story O
. O

Murdock B-PERSON
was O
unimaginative O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know O
, O
but O
this O
story O
seems O
to O
indicate O
otherwise O
. O

He O
was O
a O
splendid O
chap O
, O
sober O
and O
industrious O
. O

He O
was O
the O
only O
one O
killed O
in O
that O
wreck O
of O
the B-ORG
Central I-ORG
of I-ORG
India I-ORG
at O
Coomptah B-GPE

Knowing O
you O
are O
in O
touch O
with O
publishers O
that O
can O
handle O
this O
sort O
of O
thing O
, O
I O
have O
taken O
the O
liberty O
of O
sending O
you O
Murdock B-PERSON
’s O
document O
herewith O
, O
together O
with O
the O
envelope O
in O
which O
it O
was O
found O
. O

You O
will O
note O
that O
the O
instructions O
on O
the O
envelope O
indicate O
that O
it O
was O
to O
be O
opened O
only O
in O
the O
event O
of O
Murdock B-PERSON

TO O
WHOM O
THIS O
MAY O
CONCERN O

In O
accordance O
with O

I O
have O
filed O
with O
the O
officials O
of O
the B-ORG
Calcutta I-ORG
Traders I-ORG
’ I-ORG
Bank I-ORG
, O
this O
document O
, O
which O
is O

read O
by O
my O

in O
the O
event O
of O
my O
death O
before O
June B-DATE

, O
or O
by O
myself O
on O
that O
date O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
three B-CARDINAL
officers O
of O
the O
above O
bank O
. O

The O
reason O
for O
this O
I O
shall O
explain O
as O
clearly O
as O
possible O
. O

An O
experience O
befell O
me O
while O
doing O
geological O
work O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
of I-GPE
America I-GPE
that O
has O
profoundly O
altered O
my O
life O
, O
and O
by O
the B-DATE
year I-DATE
1931 I-DATE
, O
will O
alter O
the O
lives O
of O
every O
human O
being O
in O
the O
world O
. O

This O
statement O
, O
startling O
and O
unbelievable O
as O
it O
may O
sound O
, O
is O
nevertheless O
the O
truth O
, O
and O
is O
the O
reason O
I O
am O
writing O
, O
or O
you O
are O
reading O
this O
. O

And O
I O
am O
taking O
the O
only O
course O
consistent O
with O
my O
own O
welfare O
in O
giving O
this O
message O
to O
the O
public O
so O
that O
it O
may O
have O
even O
a O
slight O
chance O
of O
credence O
. O

So O
preposterous O
will O
be O
found O
the O
contents O
of O
this O
document O
that O
such O
fact O
alone O
will O
largely O
explain O
my O
method O
of O
procedure O
. O

I O
want O
this O
message O
to O
be O
read O
, O
to O
be O
believed O
, O
and O
to O
be O
acted O
on O
. O

Had O
I O
told O
anybody O
of O
my O
experience O
at O
the O
time O
it O
happened O
, O
I O
would O
simply O
have O
been O
the O
laughing O
stock O
of O
my O
friends O
. O

Insisting O
on O
the O
truth O
of O
the O
story O
might O
have O
been O
cause O
for O
investigation O
as O
to O
my O
sanity O
, O
and O
the O
loss O
of O
my O
position O
if O
not O
of O
my O
liberty O
. O

It O
was O
utterly O
out O
of O
the O
question O
to O
even O
think O
of O
telling O
anyone O
what O
I O
saw O
. O

I O
had O
absolutely O
no O
proof O
, O
and O
could O
not O
then O
, O
let O
alone O
now O
, O
produce O
any O
evidence O
to O
back O
up O
my O
statements O
. O

Only O
time O
will O
prove O
that O
I O
am O
right O
, O
and O
that O
will O
be O
not O
later B-DATE
than I-DATE
August I-DATE
21 I-DATE
, I-DATE
1931 I-DATE
. O

There O
is O
a O
remote O
chance O
that O
the O
catastrophe O
will O
occur O
sooner O
, O
but O
knowing O
what O
I O
do O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
it O
will O
transpire O
on O
that O
exact O
date O
. O

So O
you O
can O
see O
what O
an O
awkward O
position O
I O
am O
in O
-- O
a O
prophet O
-- O
foretelling O
happenings O
years B-DATE
ahead I-DATE
, O
to O
the B-DATE
very I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
to O
a O
skeptical O
world O
bound O
by O
the O
age B-DATE
- I-DATE
old I-DATE
dictum O
of O
common O
sense O
, O
to O
laugh O
him O
to O
scorn O
. O

This O
, O
then O
, O
is O
the O
reason O
I O
have O
made O
the O
safeguards O
for O
reading O
this O
manuscript O
. O

The O
message O
being O
so O
vital O
to O
the O
world O
, O
I O
have O
deposited O
copies O
in O
the O
largest O
banks O
in O
Bombay B-GPE
and O
Madras B-GPE
. O

These O
documents O
are O
to O
be O
mailed O
to O
me O
on O
June B-DATE
21 I-DATE
, I-DATE
1931 I-DATE
, O
or O
in O
case O
I O
die O
, O
may O
be O
obtained O
by O
my O
executors O
any O
time O
before O
that O
date O
. O

Thus O
I O
will O
avoid O
practically O
eight B-DATE
years I-DATE
of O
derision O
with O
attendant O
loss O
of O
position O
and O
probable O
confinement O
for O
mental O
instability O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
my O
warning O
is O
in O
no O
danger O
of O
being O
lost O
, O
and O
will O
be O
given O
to O
the O
world O
in O
time O
to O
do O
some O
possible O
good O
. O

If O
I O
am O
alive O
on O
June B-DATE
21 I-DATE
, I-DATE
1931 I-DATE
, O
I O
shall O
give O
my O
experience O
to O
the O
world O
on O
that O
date O
, O
allowing O
two B-DATE
months I-DATE
for O
those O
who O
heed O
it O
to O
escape O
a O
terrible O
fate O
. O

The O
reason O
I O
resigned O
my O
position O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
and O
am O
now O
in O
India B-GPE
will O
be O
disclosed O
in O
the O
narrative O
. O

IT O
was O
in O
January B-DATE
, I-DATE
1923 I-DATE
, O
that O
I O
met O
with O
this O
staggering O
experience O
. O

At O
that O
time O
I O
was O
employed O
by O
the B-ORG
Southwestern I-ORG
Syndicate I-ORG
as O
chief O
geologist O
for O
the O
Arizona B-GPE
- O
New B-GPE
Mexico I-GPE
district O
. O

I O
had O
been O
with O
them O
almost B-DATE
fifteen I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
going O
to O
them O
from O
the B-ORG
Concord I-ORG
Company I-ORG
, O
with O
whom O
I O
had O
been O
associated O
since O
my O
graduation O
from O
the B-ORG
Massachusetts I-ORG
Institute I-ORG
of I-ORG
Technology I-ORG
. O

Both O
of O
these O
companies O
, O
if O
I O
can O
judge O
by O
the O
testimonials O
they O
so O
generously O
gave O
me O
on O
my O
resignation O
, O
rated O
me O
very O
highly O
, O
and O
were O
reluctant O
to O
part O
with O
my O
services O
. O

I O
mention O
this O
not O
in O
self O
- O
praise O
, O
but O
to O
show O
that O
I O
have O
always O
had O
a O
reputation O
for O
honesty O
and O
efficient O
work O
. O

And O
I O
sincerely O
hope O
that O
this O
reputation O
will O
sustain O
me O
when O
I O
say O
that O
what O
I O
am O
about O
to O
relate O
here O
is O
the O
absolute O
truth O
. O

On O
January B-DATE
14 I-DATE
, I-DATE
1923 I-DATE
, O
Olin B-PERSON
Gilfillan I-PERSON
( O
my O
most O
trusted O
field O
lieutenant O
and O
a O
brilliant O
, O
hard O
- O
working O
man O
) O
and O
I O
set O
out O
on O
horseback O
from O
Lovington B-GPE
, O
New B-GPE
Mexico I-GPE
, O
and O
headed O
toward O
the B-FAC
Mescalero I-FAC
Ridge I-FAC
. O

We O
had O
with O
us O
a O
couple O
of O
pack O
mules O
bearing O
camping O
equipment O
and O
grub O
for O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

It O
was O
our O
intention O
to O
scout O
the O
southeast O
part O
of O
the O
Ridge B-ORG
, O
and O
report O
certain O
findings O
to O
the O
company O
. O

I O
shall O
not O
here O
relate O
any O
technical O
description O
of O
our O
route O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
my O
complete O
report O
is O
on O
file O
with O
the O
company O
in O
their O
Chicago B-GPE
office O
. O

We O
left O
Lovington B-PERSON
in O
the O
morning O
, O
and O
after O
a O
leisurely O
trip O
with O
a O
few O
stops O
for O
“ O
sighting O
, O
” O
made O
camp O
in O
a O
little O
arroyo O
leading O
up O
to O
the O
Ridge B-LOC
. O

The B-DATE
day I-DATE
had O
been O
wonderfully O
clear O
, O
and O
in O
the O
early O
twilight O
I O
worked O
on O
my O
notes O
while O
Olin B-PERSON
built O
a O
small O
fire O
of O
cedar O
and O
mesquite O
and O
prepared O
the O
coffee O
and O
bacon O
. O

After O
supper O
we O
lit O
our O
pipes O
and O
talked O
over O
various O
things O
until O
about B-CARDINAL
nine I-CARDINAL
, O
when O
we O
crawled O
into O
our O
sleeping O
bags O
. O

It O
was O
some O
time O
before O
I O
dropped O
off O
, O
as O
there O
were O
several O
problems O
connected O
with O
the O
trip O
that O
I O
kept O
reviewing O
in O
my O
mind O
. O

I O
could O
hear O
Olin B-PERSON
’s O
steady O
breathing O
, O
and O
envied O
him O
his O
ability O
to O
sleep O
soundly O
under O
any O
conditions O
. O

Up O
from O
the O
east O
swam O
a O
large O
, O
perfect O
full O
moon O
, O
flooding O
our O
camp O
in O
the O
little O
arroyo O
with O
its O
cold O
light O
. O

From O
far O
away O
came O
the O
indistinct O
, O
silly O
yapping O
of O
a O
couple O
of O
coyotes O
, O
and O
I O
could O
hear O
the O
horses O
stirring O
uneasily O
. O

Finally O
I O
fell O
asleep O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
as O
though O
I O
had O
hardly O
closed O
my O
eyes O
when O
something O
-- O
perhaps O
a O
sound O
, O
or O
maybe O
a O
premonition O
of O
something O
wrong O
-- O
caused O
me O
to O
become O
wide O
awake O
. O

I O
sat O
up O
and O
, O
noticing O
that O
the O
moon O
was O
now O
overhead O
, O
looked O
at O
my O
wrist O
watch O
. O

It O
was O
almost B-TIME
one I-TIME
o’clock I-TIME
. O

There O
seemed O
to O
be O
nothing O
amiss O
. O

Olin B-PERSON
was O
snoring O
peacefully O
, O
the O
coyotes O
were O
no O
longer O
serenading O
the O
moon O
, O
only O
a O
little O
breeze O
was O
moving O
the O
tops O
of O
the O
mesquite O
brushes O
. O

I O
glanced O
over O
to O
where O
the O
horses O
had O
been O
tethered O
, O
and O
saw O
that O
they O
were O
very O
restive O
. O

Thinking O
that O
perhaps O
some O
coyote O
was O
skulking O
about O
our O
camp O
, O
I O
crawled O
out O
of O
my O
sleeping O
bag O
, O
took O
my O
rifle O
, O
and O
went O
over O
to O
where O
the O
horses O
were O
trembling O
and O
straining O
at O
their O
tethers O
. O

They O
were O
apparently O
scared O
at O
something O
immediately O
in O
front O
of O
them O
, O
as O
they O
both O
gazed O
with O
bulging O
eyes O
in O
the O
same O
direction O
. O

Aside O
from O
a O
large O
rock O
and O
a O
few O
straggling O
sotol O
plants O
, O
I O
could O
see O
nothing O
to O
cause O
their O
fear O
. O

Thinking O
that O
perhaps O
, O
some O
creature O
had O
hidden O
behind O
the O
rock O
, O
I O
made O
my O
way O
in O
a O
wide O
circle O
around O
it O
, O
but O
there O
was O
nothing O
I O
could O
see O
to O
explain O
the O
horses O
’ O
fright O
. O

I O
went O
to O
them O
and O
stroked O
their O
noses O
; O
this O
calmed O
them O
somewhat O
, O
but O
they O
continued O
to O
gaze O
fearfully O
at O
the O
rock O
. O

IT O
came O
over O
me O
like O
a O
flash O
that O
I O
had O
not O
noticed O
that O
rock O
when O
we O
made O
camp O
-- O
in O
fact O
, O
being O
now O
fully O
wide O
awake O
, O
I O
recalled O
that O
there O
was O
no O
large O
rock O
of O
any O
kind O
near O
our O
camp O
. O

I O
blinked O
my O
eyes O
and O
pinched O
myself O
to O
see O
if O
I O
was O
really O
awake O
. O

Could O
I O
have O
been O
mistaken O
about O
my O
first B-ORDINAL
impression O
of O
our O
camp O
site O
, O
and O
have O
overlooked O
an O
object O
as O
large O
as O
that O
rock O
? O

My O
work O
has O
always O
called O
for O
keen O
observation O
, O
and O
it O
was O
absurd O
to O
think O
that O
if O
a O
fairly O
sizable O
boulder O
had O
been O
in O
sight O
, O
especially O
all O
by O
itself O
as O
this O
one O
was O
, O
I O
would O
have O
failed O
to O
note O
it O
. O

Yet O
there O
it O
was O
, O
gleaming O
dully O
in O
the O
moonlight O
, O
apparently O
firmly O
imbedded O
in O
the O
ground O
. O

But O
it O
could O
n’t O
( O
I O
reasoned O
) O
have O
been O
there O
when O
we O
first B-ORDINAL
arrived O
. O

Imagine O
two B-CARDINAL
geologists O
failing O
to O
see O
a O
rock O
of O
that O
size O
! O

How O
in O
the O
world O
could O
it O
have O
gotten O
there O
? O

Was O
it O
placed O
there O
by O
someone O
during O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
while O
we O
slept O
? O

And O
if O
so O
, O
why O
? O

But O
I O
had O
not O
noticed O
any O
footprints O
around O
it O
. O

It O
was O
obvious O
that O
it O
could O
not O
have O
rolled O
from O
anywhere O
. O

It O
had O
not O
been O
there O
four B-TIME
hours I-TIME
ago I-TIME
, O
it O
had O
not O
been O
carried O
, O
it O
had O
not O
rolled O
. O
. O
. O

In O
all O
my O
experiences O
in O
out O
- O
of O
- O
the O
- O
way O
, O
God O
- O
forsaken O
places O
, O
I O
have O
never O
known O
fear O
. O

I O
have O
been O
shot O
at O
by O
Mexicans B-NORP
, O
held O
up O
by O
thugs O
, O
even O
bitten O
by O
a O
rattlesnake O
-- O
but O
nothing O
has O
ever O
made O
me O
afraid O
. O

Not O
even O
intense O
shell O
fire O
on O
the B-ORG
Western I-ORG
Front I-ORG
, O
where O
I O
had O
served O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
month I-DATE
of O
the O
war O
as O
an O
infantry O
captain O
in O
the B-ORG
8th I-ORG
Division I-ORG
, O
ever O
made O
me O
aware O
of O
danger O
. O

I O
was O
cited O
once O
by O
the O
French B-NORP
government O
for O
bravery O
, O
but O
I O
take O
no O
credit O
for O
that O
. O

It O
is O
simply O
my O
make O
- O
up O
-- O
I O
have O
no O
“ O
nerves O
. O
” O

But O
now O
-- O
this O
inexplicable O
rock O
appearing O
from O
nowhere O
-- O
the O
very O
obvious O
fear O
it O
instilled O
in O
the O
horses-- B-PERSON

My O
first B-ORDINAL
impulse O
was O
to O
waken O
Olin B-PERSON
and O
tell O
him O
of O
this O
startling O
phenomenon O
. O

The O
remote O
possibility O
that O
I O
might O
be O
mistaken O
, O
and O
had O
for O
some O
reason O
failed O
to O
notice O
this O
rock O
, O
due O
to O
my O
absorption O
in O
my O
note O
making O
, O
deterred O
me O
. O

How O
Olin B-PERSON
would O
laugh O
at O
me O
if O
I O
roused O
him O
because O
of O
some O
foolish O
fancy O
about O
an O
innocent O
boulder O
that O
had O
been O
there O
all O
the O
time O
. O

He O
would O
never O
get O
done O
guying O
the O
life O
out O
of O
me O
. O

But O
I O
was O
positive O
that O
it O
had O
not O
been O
there O
when O
we O
made O
camp O
. O

I O
was O
debating O
whether O
to O
investigate O
the O
rock O
and O
prove O
once O
for O
all O
there O
was O
no O
cause O
for O
alarm O
, O
or O
arouse O
Olin B-PERSON
and O
get O
his O
opinion O
, O
when O
the O
rock O
was O
suddenly O
thrown O
back O
and O
I O
could O
see O
that O
it O
was O
only O
a O
hollow O
camouflage O
over O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
ground O
. O

Before O
I O
could O
cry O
out O
, O
I O
was O
seized O
from O
behind O
and O
strong O
hands O
had O
placed O
a O
gag O
in O
my O
mouth O
and O
a O
bandage O
over O
my O
eyes O
. O

I O
attempted O
to O
struggle O
, O
but O
my O
efforts O
were O
useless O
. O

It O
was O
as O
though O
my O
arms O
and O
legs O
were O
held O
in O
a O
powerful O
vise O
. O

Something O
sweetish O
that O
may O
have O
been O
chloroform O
was O
held O
over O
my O
nose O
, O
and O
before O
I O
lost O
consciousness O
I O
heard O
the O
squeal O
of O
a O
horse O
and O
the O
pounding O
of O
his O
hoofs O
as O
he O
broke O
from O
his O
tether O
and O
ran O
. O

There O
was O
no O
sound O
of O
any O
kind O
from O
my O
captors O
. O

I O
was O
dimly O
aware O
of O
being O
carried O
in O
powerful O
arms O
and O
laid O
upon O
some O
smooth O
surface O
that O
seemed O
to O
sink O
beneath O
me O
as O
darkness O
pressed O
upon O
me O
and O
I O
knew O
no O
more O
. O

HOW O
long O
it O
was O
before O
I O
regained O
consciousness O
I O
do O
not O
know O
. O

I O
seemed O
to O
hear O
a O
sort O
of O
droning O
sound O
, O
like O
the O
faraway O
purr O
of O
an O
aeroplane O
motor O
. O

For O
a O
stupefied O
instant O
I O
believed O
I O
was O
again O
in O
my O
sleeping O
bag O
, O
awakening O
from O
a O
bad O
dream O
. O

Then O
the O
recollection O
of O
the O
hollow O
rock O
and O
my O
silent O
capture O
by O
strong O
hands O
seizing O
me O
swiftly O
from O
behind O
, O
the O
thundering O
hoofs O
of O
the O
frightened O
horse O
, O
came O
over O
me O
with O
sickening O
vividness O
. O

Cautiously O
I O
moved O
my O
arms O
and O
legs O
, O
and O
found O
that O
they O
were O
not O
bound O
. O

Neither O
was O
there O
a O
gag O
in O
my O
mouth O
or O
a O
bandage O
over O
my O
eyes O
. O

It O
was O
too O
dark O
to O
see O
anything O
of O
my O
surroundings O
, O
but O
I O
could O
feel O
that O
I O
was O
lying O
on O
a O
gently O
sloping O
, O
smooth O
, O
cold O
stone O
floor O
. O

I O
got O
unsteadily O
to O
my O
feet O
and O
carefully O
extended O
my O
hands O
above O
my O
head O
. O

Though O
I O
reached O
upward O
as O
far O
as O
I O
could O
, O
I O
could O
touch O
nothing O
. O

I O
got O
down O
on O
my O
knees O
and O
groped O
around O
, O
crawling O
several O
feet O
in O
every O
direction O
, O
and O
encountered O
no O
obstacle O
of O
any O
kind O
-- O
only O
the O
smooth O
, O
dry O
stone O
that O
was O
the O
floor O
of O
my O
strange O
prison O
. O

There O
was O
no O
way O
of O
telling O
the O
dimensions O
of O
the O
room O
or O
cave O
in O
which O
I O
had O
been O
deserted O
by O
my O
mysterious O
captors O
. O

Utter O
darkness O
enveloped O
me O
like O
a O
heavy O
blanket O
. O

After O
several B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
of O
futile O
crawling O
around O
, O
I O
realized O
that O
I O
must O
be O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
some O
tremendous O
room O
, O
and O
that O
it O
was O
a O
waste O
of O
time O
trying O
to O
find O
a O
wall O
or O
outlet O
. O

My O
captors O
evidently O
knew O
that O
this O
Stygian B-NORP
blackness O
would O
effectually O
bar O
my O
escape O
, O
even O
if O
there O
were O
a O
way O
out O
, O
and O
that O
was O
undoubtedly O
the O
reason O
I O
was O
unbound O
. O

Nothing O
I O
could O
do O
would O
help O
in O
any O
way O
, O
so O
I O
might O
just O
as O
well O
await O
developments O
calmly O
. O

I O
stretched O
myself O
full O
length O
on O
the O
stone O
floor O
and O
tried O
to O
puzzle O
out O
the O
reason O
for O
my O
terrible O
predicament O
. O

That O
I O
had O
been O
kidnapped O
by O
bandits O
and O
removed O
to O
some O
cavern O
to O
await O
the O
payment O
of O
ransom O
seemed O
the O
most O
plausible O
solution O
. O

I O
wondered O
if O
they O
had O
seized O
Olin B-PERSON
Gilfillan I-PERSON
also O
. O

If O
so O
, O
why O
were O
we O
not O
together O
? O

Thinking O
he O
might O
be O
somewhere O
nearby O
, O
I O
shouted O
his O
name O
aloud O
. O

Only O
the O
hollow O
, O
booming O
echo O
of O
my O
own O
voice O
, O
sounding O
with O
eerie O
mockery O
from O
round O
about O
, O
answered O
me O
. O

I O
listened O
intently O
. O

Silence O
, O
a O
great O
, O
brooding O
silence O
, O
intensified O
by O
the O
darkness O
, O
by O
the O
magnitude O
of O
the O
cavern O
, O
and O
by O
my O
own O
breathing O
. O

I O
no O
longer O
heard O
the O
droning O
sound O
that O
I O
had O
noticed O
when O
I O
first B-ORDINAL
regained O
my O
senses O
, O
so O
it O
must O
either O
have O
been O
my O
imagination O
or O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
drug O
I O
had O
been O
forced O
to O
inhale O
. O

Undoubtedly O
I O
was O
entirely O
alone O
in O
the O
darkness O
. O

And O
if O
I O
were O
being O
held O
for O
ransom O
, O
it O
would O
, O
be O
only O
a O
question O
of O
time O
before O
my O
captors O
brought O
me O
something O
to O
eat O
and O
drink O
. O

Then O
there O
was O
the O
matter O
of O
the O
rock O
camouflage O
. O

The O
outlaws O
had O
probably O
hidden O
one O
of O
their O
number O
beneath O
it O
as O
a O
measure O
of O
precaution O
in O
case O
their O
plans O
miscarried O
. O

But O
what O
an O
elaborate O
precaution O
, O
when O
there O
were O
so O
many O
other O
simpler O
, O
and O
equally O
effective O
, O
methods O
of O
concealment O
. O

And O
they O
put O
it O
in O
a O
position O
where O
it O
would O
be O
bound O
to O
attract O
attention O
and O
investigation O
. O

Even O
putting O
it O
behind O
a O
sotol O
plant O
would O
be O
better O
than O
having O
it O
in O
the O
open O
. O

Could O
it O
have O
concealed O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
cave O
I O
was O
now O
in O
? O

Then O
, O
why O
had O
n’t O
Olin B-PERSON
or O
I O
noticed O
the O
spot O
when O
we O
made O
camp O
? O

Perhaps O
the O
bandits O
had O
covered O
the O
place O
cleverly O
, O
using O
the O
false O
rock O
only O
as O
a O
screen O
for O
exit O
and O
entrance O
. O

That O
might O
explain O
the O
sinking O
sensation O
I O
noticed O
just O
before O
the O
drug O
put O
me O
to O
sleep O
-- O
I O
was O
probably O
lowered O
into O
the O
ground O
at O
this O
point O
. O

I O
well O
knew O
that O
there O
were O
countless O
caves O
in O
this O
southeastern O
part O
of O
New B-GPE
Mexico I-GPE
. O

The O
mighty O
Carlsbad B-LOC
Cavern I-LOC
itself O
has O
a O
great O
number O
of O
branching O
chambers O
that O
have O
never O
been O
explored O
. O

What O
could O
be O
more O
perfect O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
kidnapping O
for O
ransom O
than O
a O
well O
- O
concealed O
entrance O
to O
an O
unknown O
cavern O
in O
this O
rugged O
, O
little O
- O
traveled O
country O
? O

In O
many O
places O
near O
the B-FAC
Carlsbad I-FAC
Cavern I-FAC
the O
roof O
has O
fallen O
in O
, O
leaving O
deep O
depressions O
in O
the O
ground O
; O
in O
fact O
, O
the O
natural O
entrance O
to O
this O
cavern O
is O
in O
one O
of O
such O
depressions O
. O

The O
more O
I O
thought O
this O
over O
, O
the O
more O
I O
became O
convinced O
that O
my O
captors O
had O
cunningly O
concealed O
a O
comparatively O
small O
entrance O
to O
their O
own O
private O
cave O
, O
and O
that O
we O
, O
unfortunately O
happening O
to O
camp O
close O
by O
, O
provided O
easy O
prey O
for O
their O
first B-ORDINAL
attempt O
. O

HOW O
they O
could O
have O
made O
the O
place O
look O
like O
ordinary O
flat O
ground O
, O
with O
no O
footprints O
or O
other O
signs O
of O
disturbance O
anywhere O
, O
puzzled O
me O
greatly O
. O

Several O
of O
them O
had O
come O
out O
and O
had O
seized O
me O
from O
behind O
, O
but O
how O
had O
they O
covered O
their O
tracks O
, O
and O
where O
had O
they O
hidden O
that O
I O
did O
not O
see O
them O
as O
I O
gazed O
around O
? O

They O
must O
have O
come O
from O
some O
distance O
off O
, O
and O
been O
lightning O
quick O
to O
get O
me O
as O
they O
did O
. O

And O
having O
captured O
me O
so O
neatly O
and O
noiselessly O
, O
why O
was O
I O
now O
left O
alone O
with O
my O
thoughts O
, O
free O
to O
blunder O
around O
and O
break O
my O
neck O
in O
the O
darkness O
? O

They O
evidently O
thought O
to O
cow O
me O
, O
so O
that O
I O
would O
prove O
tractable O
, O
using O
the O
terror O
that O
comes O
from O
darkness O
and O
solitude O
as O
their O
trump O
card O
. O

I O
resolved O
that O
, O
come O
what O
might O
, O
I O
would O
never O
let O
them O
believe O
that O
I O
felt O
the O
slightest O
fear O
. O

And O
I O
further O
resolved O
that O
once O
I O
was O
free O
, O
I O
would O
leave O
no O
stone O
unturned O
to O
seek O
out O
this O
rendezvous O
and O
capture O
the O
whole O
gang O
, O
if O
it O
took O
half B-CARDINAL
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
army O
. O

Why O
I O
have O
not O
done O
this O
will O
be O
made O
evident O
as O
I O
continue O
. O

Just O
as O
I O
had O
thoroughly O
determined O
to O
make O
bravery O
my O
one O
inflexible O
gesture O
, O
no O
matter O
what O
they O
did O
to O
me O
, O
I O
became O
aware O
of O
a O
presence O
approaching O
. O

It O
was O
only O
the O
faintest O
sort O
of O
rustling O
sound O
, O
as O
though O
someone O
in O
a O
flapping O
kimono O
and O
sandals O
were O
walking O
toward O
me O
. O

That O
someone O
, O
or O
something O
, O
was O
coming O
toward O
me O
in O
absolute O
darkness O
, O
apparently O
moving O
at O
a O
steady O
pace O
in O
spite O
of O
that O
fact O
, O
made O
my O
bravery O
dissolve O
into O
thin O
air O
. O

After O
all O
, O
what O
is O
fear O
? O

We O
can O
steel O
ourselves O
to O
meet O
known O
dangers O
philosophically O
, O
or O
even O
unknown O
ones O
if O
they O
are O
not O
totally O
unexpected O
; O
but O
when O
we O
are O
suddenly O
confronted O
with O
the O
unknown O
, O
with O
all O
its O
potentialities O
of O
horror O
aggravated O
by O
the O
awful O
cloak O
of O
inky O
darkness O
, O
or O
any O
equally O
terrifying O
circumstance O
, O
we O
become O
as O
frightened O
children O
. O

It O
is O
only O
natural O
. O

As O
the O
rustling O
sound O
grew O
louder O
, O
I O
involuntarily O
uttered O
a O
stifled O
, O
sobbing O
moan O
, O
and O
sought O
to O
crawl O
away O
in O
the O
opposite O
direction O
. O

I O
found O
that O
I O
could O
not O
move O
. O

I O
was O
paralyzed O
with O
a O
blind O
, O
unreasoning O
, O
sickening O
fear O
. O

I O
felt O
faint O
with O
nausea O
, O
and O
my O
teeth O
clicked O
together O
, O
as O
though O
I O
were O
perishing O
with O
cold O
. O

I O
have O
said O
before O
that O
I O
have O
no O
“ O
nerves O
” O
and O
that O
ordinary O
perils O
have O
never O
ovecome O
me O
; O
but O
this O
was O
no O
ordinary O
situation O
, O
and O
what O
I O
had O
already O
been O
through O
paved O
the O
way O
to O
this O
climax O
of O
complete O
terror O
. O

I O
felt O
that O
death O
, O
sudden O
and O
painless O
, O
would O
be O
the O
most O
welcome O
thing O
that O
could O
happen O
. O

Whatever O
it O
was O
, O
stopped O
near O
me O
and O
I O
could O
hear O
it O
breathing O
faintly O
. O

I O
tried O
desperately O
to O
control O
the O
clacking O
of O
my O
teeth O
and O
the O
trembling O
of O
my O
limbs O
. O

I O
cursed O
myself O
for O
having O
called O
Olin B-PERSON
, O
for O
the O
noise O
, O
no O
doubt O
, O
had O
attracted O
the O
creature O
’s O
attention O
. O

As O
I O
could O
see O
nothing O
, O
not O
even O
the O
faintest O
indication O
of O
glowing O
eyes O
, O
my O
terror O
- O
stricken O
mind O
finally O
grasped O
the O
fact O
that O
no O
beast O
was O
near O
me O
; O
it O
was O
probably O
only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
of O
my O
captors O
. O

Yet O
, O
how O
had O
he O
found O
his O
way O
to O
me O
, O
and O
where O
had O
he O
come O
from O
. O

My O
terror O
died O
away O
as O
quickly O
as O
it O
had O
come O
, O
leaving O
me O
still O
trembling O
and O
faint O
, O
but O
with O
my O
mind O
alert O
for O
what O
might O
follow O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
strange O
. O

A O
RUSTLING O
sound O
close O
to O
my O
head O
and O
something O
touched O
me O
on O
the O
shoulder O
. O

It O
was O
a O
hand O
, O
bony O
, O
long O
- O
fingered O
, O
powerful O
, O
that O
seized O
my O
shoulder O
and O
pulled O
me O
up O
to O
a O
sitting O
position O
. O

“ O
Drink O
! O
” O
said O
a O
voice O
close O
to O
my O
ear O
. O

“ O
Put O
your O
hands O
before O
your O
face O
, O
and O
take O
the O
bowl O
that O
is O
offered O
you O
. O
” O

The O
voice O
had O
a O
peculiar O
rasping O
quality O
, O
as O
if O
the O
speaker O
were O
having O
difficulty O
in O
controlling O
his O
tongue O
, O
and O
the O
pronunciation O
of O
the O
words O
was O
done O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
guttural O
drawl O
. O

“ O
What O
is O
it O
you O
offer O
me O
to O
drink O
? O
” O

I O
asked O
my O
unseen O
visitor O
, O
in O
the O
bravest O
voice O
I O
could O
muster O
, O
“ O
and O
why O
have O
I O
been O
brought O
here O
? O
” O

The O
hand O
on O
my O
shoulder O
slowly O
tightened O
until O
I O
winced O
with O
pain O
. O

Against O
my O
lips O
was O
pressed O
the O
rim O
of O
a O
rough O
, O
earthen O
bowl O
filled O
with O
some O
cold O
liquid O
. O

“ O
Drink O
! O
” O

again O
said O
the O
voice O
, O
and O
I O
sensed O
the O
menace O
in O
the O
metallic O
, O
rasping O
words O
, O
“ O
to O
struggle O
is O
useless O
, O
for O
you O
can O
not O
see O
in O
the O
dark O
. O

Do O
as O
you O
are O
told O
, O
or O
you O
shall O
be O
pinioned O
and O
forcibly O
made O
to O
drink O
. O

The O
liquid O
will O
not O
harm O
you O
, O
if O
that O
is O
why O
you O
are O
fearful O
. O
” O

The O
pain O
from O
his O
tremendous O
grip O
on O
my O
shoulder O
was O
too O
much O
. O

It O
would O
indeed O
be O
of O
no O
avail O
to O
struggle O
in O
the O
dark O
with O
an O
unknown O
, O
powerful O
adversary O
who O
was O
apparently O
thoroughly O
indifferent O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
light O
. O

There O
was O
nothing O
to O
do O
but O
drink O
, O
and O
hope O
that O
he O
told O
the O
truth O
in O
saying O
no O
harm O
lay O
therein O
. O

It O
was O
only O
a O
small O
bowl O
, O
holding O
little O
more O
than O
an O
ordinary O
glass O
, O
and O
I O
quaffed O
the O
whole O
potion O
in O
large O
gulps O
. O

It O
tasted O
no O
different O
than O
ordinary O
water O
. O

“ O
That O
is O
better O
, O
” O
came O
the O
voice O
, O
as O
the O
bowl O
was O
taken O
from O
me O
and O
the O
hand O
on O
my O
shoulder O
removed O
, O
“ O
now O
I O
shall O
talk O
to O
you O
. O

Sit O
quite O
still O
. O

You O
can O
not O
possibly O
escape O
, O
and O
besides O
I O
can O
see O
you O
perfectly O
, O
so-- O
” O
I O
gave O
a O
gasp O
of O
incredulity O
. O

It O
was O
conceivable O
that O
the O
owner O
of O
this O
voice O
might O
be O
so O
used O
to O
the O
dark O
that O
he O
could O
make O
his O
way O
around O
; O
but O
as O
for O
seeing O
me O
perfectly O
in O
this O
smothering O
blackness O
. O
. O
. O

the O
man O
must O
be O
mad O
! O

That O
was O
it O
! O

I O
had O
been O
captured O
by O
some O
lunatic O
, O
and O
brought O
to O
this O
underground O
cavern O
for O
a O
terrible O
purpose O
. O

My O
only O
chance O
was O
to O
humor O
the O
creature O
, O
to O
use O
my O
wits O
and O
watch O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
overpower O
him O
. O

He O
was O
evidently O
endowed O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
sixth B-ORDINAL
sense O
, O
and O
I O
would O
have O
to O
bide O
my O
time O
. O

Then O
, O
his O
voice O
-- O
it O
was O
not O
the O
voice O
of O
a O
normal O
human O
being O
. O

“ O
I O
see O
that O
you O
do O
not O
believe O
my O
statement O
, O
” O
went O
on O
that O
drawling O
, O
peculiar O
voice O
. O

“ O
You O
think O
that O
it O
is O
not O
possible O
for O
anyone O
to O
see O
in O
the O
dark O
. O

You O
not O
only O
think O
I O
am O
lying O
, O
but O
you O
think O
I O
am O
crazy O
. O

When O
I O
get O
done O
talking O
to O
you O
, O
it O
will O
be O
surprising O
if O
you O
do O
not O
think O
yourself O
crazy O
instead O
. O

We O
know O
no O
difference O
between O
light O
and O
dark O
, O
such O
as O
you O
dwellers O
on O
the O
Earth B-LOC
. O

Light O
is O
used O
by O
us O
only O
to O
intensify O
that O
which O
we O
already O
see O
-- O
it O
is O
similar O
to O
what O
magnification O
would O
be O
to O
you O
. O

Light O
makes O
a O
reaction O
on O
certain O
nerves O
of O
ours O
, O
corresponding O
to O
your O
optic O
nerves O
, O
that O
simply O
intensifies O
the O
image O
. O

The O
stronger O
the O
light O
, O
the O
larger O
the O
image O
. O

As O
I O
look O
at O
you O
now O
, O
you O
are O
your O
normal O
size O
. O

We O
have O
lived O
and O
worked O
so O
long O
here O
that O
we O
are O
even O
more O
partial O
to O
dark O
than O
to O
light O
, O
although O
in O
our O
work O
we O
find O
it O
necessary-- O
” O
“ O
Just B-TIME
a I-TIME
minute I-TIME
, O
” O
I O
broke O
in O
, O
realizing O
now O
that O
there O
was O
indeed O
a O
dangerous O
madman O
on O
my O
hands O
, O
and O
that O
only O
if O
I O
pretended O
to O
keep O
up O
a O
discussion O
on O
the O
topic O
which O
obsessed O
him O
could O
I O
hope O
to O
gain O
his O
good O
graces O
, O
“ O
you O
must O
remember O
that O
I O
have O
only O
just O
arrived O
, O
and O
know O
nothing O
about O
you O
or O
your O
work O
. O

Where O
are O
the O
others O
who O
are O
associated O
with O
you O
? O

Did O
you O
bring O
me O
here O
to O
help O
you O
in O
any O
way O
? O

I O
’ll O
be O
glad O
to O
do O
anything O
I O
can O
. O
” O

“ O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
you O
will O
be O
needed O
after O
all O
, O
” O
said O
the O
voice O
, O
“ O
I O
am O
appointed O
to O
look O
after O
you O
until O
-- O
well O
, O
until O
you O
are O
summoned O
. O

The O
others O
you O
will O
see O
in O
due O
time O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
as O
you O
have O
that O
human O
trait O
of O
curiosity O
and O
your O
face O
has O
expressed O
bewilderment O
and O
incredulity O
at O
certain O
things O
I O
have O
said O
, O
I O
shall O
explain O
what O
and O
who O
I O
am O
, O
so O
that O
you O
will O
grasp O
what O
I O
am O
talking O
about O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
I O
am O
not O
a O
human O
being O
. O

Do O
not O
, O
however O
, O
let O
that O
fact O
alarm O
you O
. O

Because O
you O
can O
not O
see O
me O
, O
and O
because O
I O
am O
talking O
to O
you O
in O
a O
language O
you O
can O
understand O
, O
you O
think O
I O
am O
utterly O
insane O
. O

You O
will O
shortly O
see O
for O
yourself O
that O
I O
am O
right O
. O

Listen O
carefully O
to O
what O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
so O
that O
you O
will O
be O
prepared O
to O
comprehend O
what O
will O
be O
shown O
you O
later O
. O
” O

“ O
But O
if O
you O
are O
not O
a O
human O
being O
, O
” O
I O
expostulated O
in O
a O
bewildered O
tone O
of O
voice O
that O
I O
strove O
to O
make O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
“ O
what O
are O
you O
? O

You O
speak O
English B-LANGUAGE
very O
well O
, O
and O
only O
human O
beings O
can O
talk O
. O

Are O
you O
a O
god O
of O
some O
sort O
? O
” O

I O
thought O
by O
this O
remark O
to O
flatter O
the O
fellow O
, O
and O
thus O
draw O
him O
out O
further O
in O
his O
absurd O
statements O
. O

“ O
Foolish O
one O
, O
of O
course O
I O
am O
not O
a O
god O
. O

But O
your O
question O
is O
reasonable O
, O
nevertheless O
. O

You O
suppose O
that O
only O
human O
beings O
can O
talk O
, O
which O
is O
correct O
as O
far O
as O
it O
applies O
to O
inhabitants O
of O
this O
planet O
. O

My O
parents O
came O
from O
the O
planet O
you O
know O
as O
Venus B-LOC
about B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
of O
your O
years B-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
and O
I O
myself O
was O
born O
here O
, O
in O
this O
cavern O
! O
” O

AT O
this O
amazing O
statement O
I O
must O
have O
registered O
a O
very O
ludicrous O
astonishment O
, O
for O
my O
invisible O
captor O
gave O
a O
deep O
, O
throaty O
laugh O
and O
continued O
: O
“ O
It O
is O

You O
, O
too O
, O
would O
laugh O
. O

You O
see O
, O
we O
are O
not O
without O
a O
sense O
of O
humor O
. O

I O
know O
your O
head O
is O
seething O
with O
a O
conflicting O
tumult O
of O
thoughts O
. O

How O
did O
I O
know O
your O
name O
? O

From O
the O
notebook O
you O
had O
in O
your O
shirt O
pocket O

You O
would O
no O
doubt O
be O
interested O
in O
my O

It O
is O
Oomlag B-ORG

, O
or O
Oomlag B-ORG
for O
short O
. O

You O
may O
call O
me O
that O
. O

I O
am O
sorry O
that O
I O
can O
not O
let O
you O
see O
my O
face O
just O
now O
, O
but O
we O
prepare O
all O
our O
involuntary O
visitors O
with O
a O
little O
talk O
in O
the O
dark O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
so O
that O
our O
intentions O
will O
be O
made O
clear O
and O
they O
can O
better O
stand O
the O
shock O
of O
seeing O
us O
and O
our O
work O

” O

“ O
Do O
you O
mean O
to O
tell O
me O
that O
other O
people O
have O
been O
brought O
here O
, O
too O
? O
” O

I O
shuddered O
at O
the O
thought O
. O

“ O
What O
do O
you O
want O
with O
us O
-- O
with O
me O
-- O
and O
what O
becomes O
of O
us--‘involuntary B-PERSON
visitors O

? O
” O

Again O
came O
the O
gurgling O
laugh O
. O

“ O
Oh O
, O
we O
have O
a O
certain O
very O
definite O
purpose O
with O
you O

We O
would O
not O

We O
have O
only O
invited O
a O
very O
few O
visitors O

but O
they O
are O
all O
people O
of O
much O
more O
than O
ordinary O
intelligence O
, O
such O
as O
yourself O
, O
and O
peculiarly O
fitted O
to O
aid O
us O
in O
our O
-- O
ah O
, O
purpose O
. O
” O

I O
realized O
fully O
my O
terrible O
position O
-- O
talking O
in O
black O
darkness O
with O
a O
madman O
who O
claimed O
that O
his O
parents O
came O
from O
Venus B-LOC
, O
that O
others O
were O
associated O
with O
him O
in O
some O
sinister O
undertaking O
here O
in O
the O
cavern O
, O
and O
that O
several O
other O
people O
had O
also O
been O
made O
prisoners O
, O
for O
what O
unholy O
purposes O
I O
could O
not O
guess O
. O

The O
darkness O
and O
the O
strength O
of O
my O
unwelcome O
host O
were O
against O
me O
. O

In O
despair O
, O
I O
was O
now O
certain O
that O
my O
only O
hope O
was O
to O
draw O
him O
out O
in O
“ O
a O
little O
talk O
, O
” O
and O
perhaps O
thereby O
gain O
information O
to O
help O
me O
escape O
, O
or O
, O
by O
pretending O
to O
be O
very O
eager O
to O
help O
him O
, O
to O
insinuate O
myself O
into O
his O
good O
graces O
and O
catch O
him O
unaware O
at O
a O
favorable O
moment O
. O

“ O
YOU O
tell O
me O
, O
” O
I O
said O
, O
as O
casually O
as O
possible O
, O
“ O
that O
your O
visitors O

allowed O

see O

that O

by O
a O
little O
explanatory O

here O
in O
the O
dark O

better O
withstand O
the O
‘ O
shock O

Would O
it O
be O
presumptuous O
of O
me O
to O
ask O
why O
it O
should O
be O
a O
shock O
to O
see O
you O
and O

” O

“ O
Not O
at O
all O
, O
” O
came O
the O
voice O
of O
Oomlag B-ORG
. O

“ O
But O
before O
I O
do O
that O
, O
you O
should O
be O
enlightened O
further O
as O
to O
why O
you O
are O
here O

In O
a O
way O
, O
you O
are O
our O
slave O

in O
the O
sense O
at O

, O
that O
you O
will O
be O
compelled O
by O

to O
spend O
the B-DATE

However O

if O
you O

you O

If O

after O

been O
fully O
explained O

you O

you O
do O
not O

can O
only O
say O
that O
you O

“ O
Now O

if O
you O
will O
be O
kind O
enough O
not O

interrupt O

I O
shall O
give O
you O
a O
little O
discourse O
that O
you O

not O

No O

You O
have O
all O

at O

try O

be O
less O
apt O
to O
think O
it O
is O
all O
a O
dream O
or O
that O
you O
have O
lost O
your O
reason O
. O

“ O
As O
I O
said O
before O
, O
we O
are O
from O
the O
planet O
you O
call O
Venus B-LOC
. O

For O
many O
hundreds O
of O
years O
past O
we O
have O
been O
in O
a O
high O
state O
of O
civilization O
, O
one O
as O
far O
superior O
to O
yours O
as O
yours O
is O
to O
that O
of O
the O
crudest O
cave O
- O
man O
. O

We O
have O
developed O
certain O
scientific O
instruments O
and O
discovered O
forces O
that O
enable O
us O
to O
do O
things O
scarcely O
dreamed O
of O
by O
your O
scientists O
. O

Some O
of O
these O
things O
you O
will O
be O
shown O
in O
due O
time O
. O

It O
is O
well O
that O
we O
have O
made O
the O
wonderful O
advance O
that O
we O
have O
, O
for O
it O
has O
given O
us O
the O
secret O
of O
interplanetary O
flight O
, O
and O
in O
time O
to O
relieve O
the O
pressure O
of O
our O
population O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
your O
earth O
is O
only O
a O
little O
larger O
than O
ours O
, O
some B-PERCENT
10 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
, O
and O
though O
almost B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
again O
as O
far O
away O
from O
the O
sun O
, O
your O
atmosphere O
is O
even O
better O
suited O
to O
us O
than O
our O
own O
. O

It O
is O
cooler O
and O
more O
stimulating O
. O

We O
were O
energetic O
enough O
as O
it O
was O
, O
but O
here O
on O
your O
earth O
we O
are O
paragons O
of O
energy O
. O

After O
we O
have O
conquered O
you O
and O
eventually O
exterminated O
you O
, O
as O
all O
your O
own O
superior O
tribes O
have O
done O
to O
your O
own O
inferior O
ones O
, O
we O
shall O
be O
the O
absolute O
masters O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
planets O
. O

With O
what O
we O
already O
know O
, O
plus O
things O
we O
shall O
find O
out O
as O
we O
begin O
to O
expand O
, O
I O
know O
that O
our O
population O
problem O
will O
not O
bother O
us O
again O
for O
untold O
centuries B-DATE
. O

“ O
After O
we O
have O
consolidated O
our O
position O
here O
, O
we O
intend O
to O
make O
an O
expedition O
to O
the O
ruddy O
planet O
you O
call O
Mars B-LOC
. O

We O
do O
not O
intend O
to O
settle O
, O
as O
conditions O
are O
not O
at O
all O
favorable O
for O
prolonged O
life O
there O
for O
us O
; O
but O
we O
do O
intend O
to O
see O
that O
the O
Martian B-NORP
civilization O
is O
broken O
and O
we O
ourselves O
secure O
from O
their O
menace O
. O

Though O
we O
can O
not O
live O
comfortably O
on O
their O
planet O
, O
they O
can O
on O
yours O
, O
so O
it O
is O
wise O
to O
crush O
them O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
, O
as O
they O
have O
a O
rather O
advanced O
civilization O
and O
might O
outdo O
us O
later O
. O

As O
for O
the O
larger O
planets O
known O
to O
you O
, O
such O
as O
Saturn B-PRODUCT
, O
Neptune B-LOC
, O
and O
Uranus B-LOC
, O
and O
our O
smaller O
neighbor O
, O
Mercury B-ORG
, O
they O
may O
be O
disregarded O
, O
some O
being O
populated O
by O
crude O
insect O
- O
like O
creatures O
and O
others O
having O
only O
a O
low O
form O
of O
vegetation O
. O

Besides O
, O
their O
mass O
alone O
would O
prohibit O
our O
survival O
, O
even O
as O
it O
would O
yours O
. O

Though O
I O
weigh O
several B-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
more O
here O
on O
your O
Earth B-LOC
than O
I O
would O
on O
Venus B-LOC
, O
its O
only O
effect O
is O
to O
give O
a O
corresponding O
feeling O
of O
well O
- O
being O
. O

Those O
who O
have O
come O
here O
direct O
, O
as O
my O
parents O
, O
say O
it O
is O
like O
a O
man O
under O
weight O
getting O
his O
full O
quota O
of O
flesh O
; O
he O
feels O
stronger O
, O
and O
he O
is O
stronger O
. O
” O

THE O
creature O
paused O
, O
and O
I O
could O
hear O
his O
garments O
rustling O
. O

In O
spite O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
still O
thought O
I O
was O
dealing O
with O
a O
lunatic O
, O
I O
felt O
but O
little O
fear O
. O

Though O
the O
strange O
throaty O
quality O
of O
his O
voice O
gave O
the O
words O
an O
accent O
rather O
difficult O
to O
understand O
at O
times O
, O
his O
choice O
of O
English B-LANGUAGE
was O
excellent O
and O
stamped O
him O
as O
a O
man O
with O
a O
splendid O
education O
. O

Perhaps O
he O
was O
some O
professor O
of O
astronomy O
who O
had O
become O
insane O
from O
overstudy B-GPE
, O
and O
was O
living O
his O
life O
underground O
, O
clever O
enough O
to O
wrest O
a O
living O
by O
going O
at O
times O
to O
the O
outside O
world O
and O
obtaining O
food O
somehow O
. O

Long O
familiarity O
with O
his O
habitat O
undoubtedly O
explained O
his O
uncanny O
ability O
to O
get O
around O
in O
the O
dark O
, O
and O
sense O
my O
position O
. O

And O
his O
rock O
camouflage O
-- O
that O
was O
wonderfully O
clever O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
would O
rather O
deal O
with O
an O
intelligent O
man O
obsessed O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
subject O
than O
with O
a O
rambling O
, O
mumbling O
idiot O
. O

Could O
there O
be O
any O
truth O
about O
others O
working O
with O
him O
? O

Hardly O
. O

Later O
he O
would O
probably O
point O
out O
an O
imaginary O
series O
of O
tunnels O
and O
what O
not O
, O
firmly O
believing O
everything O
was O
there O
. O

If O
I O
was O
diplomatic O
enough O
I O
might O
get O
him O
to O
show O
me O
the O
entrance O
through O
which O
he O
had O
brought O
me O
, O
and O
then O
make O
a O
break O
for O
freedom O
. O
. O
. O
. O

My O
face O
must O
have O
betrayed O
my O
growing O
interest O
and O
lack O
of O
fear O
, O
for O
Oomlag B-ORG
’s O
next O
remark O
indicated O
as O
much O
. O

“ O
What O
do O
you O
say O
now O
, O
Stan B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
lee I-PERSON
? O
” O

he O
asked O
me O
, O
his O
garments O
still O
rustling O
like O
strips O
of O
dry O
, O
hard O
leather O
rubbing O
against O
each O
other O
. O

“ O
Have O
I O
told O
you O
enough O
to O
make O
you O
realize O
how O
very O
much O
you O
are O
in O
my O
power O
, O
and O
to O
make O
you O
wish O
to O
see O
the O
things O
I O
have O
mentioned O
; O
or O
do O
you O
wish O
to O
ask O
questions O
about O
things O
I O
have O
overlooked O
? O

Our O
Field O
General O
has O
communicated O
with O
me O
, O
wanting O
to O
know O
if O
you O
are O
sufficiently O
enlightened O
. O

If O
you O
care O
to O
proceed O
now O
, O
I O
shall O
give O
the O
signal O
and O
we O
may O
advance O
; O
but O
if O
you O
are O
still O
afraid O
for O
your O
safety O
, O
further O
parley O
is O
your O
privilege O
. O
” O

My O
mind O
was O
made O
up O
. O

Under O
the O
circumstances O
, O
there O
was O
only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
thing O
I O
could O
do O
-- O
go O
with O
the O
fellow O
, O
and O
find O
out O
once O
for O
all O
whether O
he O
was O
a O
lunatic O
or O
not O
. O

I O
could O
only O
hope O
I O
would O
not O
be O
hurled O
into O
some O
pit O
in O
the O
darkness O
. O

“ O
Sure O
, O
Oomlag B-ORG
, O
” O
I O
said O
, O
striving O
to O
seem O
very O
enthusiastic O
, O
“ O
bring O
on O
your O
big O
show O
! O

Tell O
your O
General O
I O
am O
ready O
, O
and O
that O
my O
services O
are O
at O
his O
disposal O
. O

I O
think O
I O
can O
stand O
about O
any O
shock O
now O
. O
” O

“ O
You O
stood O
the O
darkness O
test O
better O
than O
most O
, O
” O
remarked O
Oomlag B-ORG
, O
dryly O
. O

“ O
Usually O
we O
must O
speak O
long O
before O
we O
get O
near O
enough O
to O
touch O
. O

The O
fluid O
you O
drank O
was O
water O
with O
a O
mild O
drug O
to O
make O
your O
mind O
more O
active O
. O

Since O
you O
are O
ready O
, O
I O
will O
give O
the O
signal O
. O
” O

Again O
his O
garments O
rustled O
. O

About B-TIME
a I-TIME
minute I-TIME
passed O
, O
but O
nothing O
happened O
to O
break O
the O
impenetrable O
darkness O
or O
my O
keyed O
- O
up O
sense O
of O
suspense O
. O

“ O
The O
Field O
General O
says O
to O
bring O
you O
in O
. O

Stand O
up O
, O
Stan B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
lee I-PERSON
! O
” O

Oomlag B-ORG
ordered O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
grasping O
my O
right O
elbow O
with O
his O
lean O
, O
powerful O
fingers O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
I O
was O
on O
my O
feet O
, O
he O
faced O
me O
half B-CARDINAL
way O
around O
and O
gave O
me O
a O
little O
shove O
. O

“ O
Walk O
straight O
forward O
until O
I O
tell O
you O
to O
stop O
! O
” O

he O
commanded O
, O
the O
gruff O
, O
guttural O
words O
being O
spoken O
close O
to O
my O
ear O
, O
“ O
and O
do O
not O
speak O
a O
word O
. O

Say O
nothing O
until O
you O
receive O
my O
permission O
. O
” O

I O
took O
a O
few O
slow O
, O
shuffling O
steps O
into O
the O
darkness O
, O
hands O
held O
before O
my O
face O
. O

“ O
Walk O
naturally O
! O
” O

Oomlag B-ORG
whispered O
, O
and O
there O
was O
nothing O
to O
do O
but O
obey O
. O

The O
floor O
of O
the O
cave O
sloped O
gently O
down O
, O
and O
I O
expected O
momentarily O
to O
go O
hurtling O
into O
some O
chasm O
. O

I O
was O
wholly O
at O
the O
mercy O
of O
this O
strange O
being O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
steel O
myself O
for O
whatever O
might O
happen O
. O

I O
imagine O
that O
walking O
the O
plank O
would O
be O
a O
similar O
sensation O
, O
the O
only O
difference O
being O
the O
certainty O
of O
destruction O
. O

AFTER O
I O
had O
taken O
about B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
steps O
, O
the O
floor O
seemed O
to O
become O
level O
. O

Oomlag B-ORG
was O
right O
behind O
me O
. O

I O
could O
hear O
the O
soft O
shuffle O
of O
his O
feet O
and O
rustle O
of O
his O
clothes O
. O

But O
he O
gave O
me O
no O
more O
spoken O
directions O
. O

Either O
I O
happened O
to O
be O
going O
in O
the O
right O
direction O
, O
or O
, O
what O
was O
more O
probable O
, O
I O
was O
being O
guided O
by O
some O
unknown O
influence O
. O

The O
floor O
continued O
level O
, O
and O
we O
must O
have O
walked O
fully O
five B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
in O
the O
dense O
blackness O
of O
the O
place O
before O
I O
noticed O
a O
little O
draft O
of O
warm O
air O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
I O
became O
aware O
of O
a O
rather O
high O
- O
pitched O
humming O
sound O
that O
grew O
louder O
as O
we O
moved O
forward O
. O

Then O
I O
began O
to O
hear O
more O
shuffling O
sounds O
, O
and O
a O
sort O
of O
subdued O
murmuring O
on O
all O
sides O
, O
as O
though O
a O
crowd O
of O
people O
were O
gathered O
and O
whispering O
to O
one B-CARDINAL
another O
. O

Suddenly O
Oomlag B-ORG
’s O
hand O
grasped O
my O
shoulder O
and O
stopped O
me O
in O
my O
tracks O
. O

Without O
uttering O
a O
word O
, O
we O
stood O
there O
, O
his O
hand O
still O
gripping O
my O
shoulder O
. O

My O
senses O
were O
keenly O
acute O
, O
and O
I O
knew O
, O
from O
the O
indistinct O
rustlings O
and O
murmurings O
I O
could O
hear O
, O
that O
we O
were O
surrounded O
by O
other O
beings O
. O

Slowly O
, O
as O
the O
lights O
in O
a O
theater O
are O
gradually O
turned O
on O
, O
objects O
around O
me O
became O
visible O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
I O
could O
make O
out O
several O
shadowy O
, O
tall O
figures O
standing O
about O
on O
all O
sides O
, O
and O
the O
outlines O
of O
two B-CARDINAL
enormous O
white O
stalagmites O
. O

As O
the O
light O
became O
brighter O
by O
imperceptible O
degrees O
, O
I O
could O
see O
that O
it O
emanated O
from O
a O
multitude O
of O
octagonal O
crystals O
set O
in O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
cavern O
at O
regular O
intervals O
. O

Before O
me O
rose O
up O
a O
sort O
of O
throne O
built O
into O
a O
large O
niche O
in O
the O
cavern O
wall O
, O
and O
on O
this O
throne O
, O
apparently O
hewn O
from O
the O
living O
rock O
, O
sat O
one O
of O
the O
most O
preposterous O
- O
looking O
beings O
the O
imagination O
of O
man O
could O
conceive O
. O

The O
two B-CARDINAL
stalagmites O
flanked O
this O
throne O
on O
either O
side O
, O
and O
other O
bizarre O
creatures O
were O
thronged O
in O
the O
space O
between O
the O
stalagmites O
and O
below O
the O
throne O
. O

I O
shall O
do O
my O
best O
to O
describe O
the O
Field B-ORG
General I-ORG
commanding O
the O
hordes O
from O
Venus B-LOC
that O
are O
to O
conquer O
our O
earth O
in O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
short I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

I O
was O
sickened O
by O
the O
revelation O
that O
Oomlag B-ORG
was O
indeed O
no O
madman O
, O
but O
really O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
an O
invincible O
vanguard O
with O
the O
world O
in O
their O
grasp O
. O

The O
Field O
General O
, O
as O
Oomlag B-ORG
had O
termed O
him O
, O
was O
a O
terrible O
thing O
to O
look O
upon O
. O

A O
tall O
figure O
, O
well O
over O
seven B-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
, O
with O
unbelievably O
long O
, O
skinny O
arms O
and O
legs O
, O
a O
torso O
like O
a O
pouter O
- O
pigeon O
, O
and O
above O
it O
, O
set O
on O
a O
short O
, O
thick O
neck O
, O
a O
head O
shaped O
like O
an O
ostrich O
egg O
. O

The O
head O
was O
entirely O
bald O
, O
covered O
with O
skin O
like O
parchment O
and O
of O
a O
most O
revolting O
ochre O
yellow O
color O
. O

The O
ears O
tapered O
almost O
to O
a O
point O
; O
the O
eyes O
, O
small O
and O
set O
close O
together O
, O
burned O
like O
those O
of O
a O
cat O
in O
the O
dark O
; O
the O
nose O
was O
very O
wide O
and O
flat O
, O
almost O
pig O
- O
like O
; O
and O
the O
mouth O
, O
thick O
- O
lipped O
and O
exceedingly O
wide O
, O
was O
doubly O
hideous O
due O
to O
the O
total O
absence O
of O
chin O
. O

In O
conversation O
later O
he O
revealed O
his O
teeth O
, O
the O
front O
four B-CARDINAL
evidently O
filed O
to O
a O
point O
and O
the O
rest O
flat O
; O
all O
of O
a O
dark O
gray O
color O
. O

He O
was O
clothed O
in O
some O
sort O
of O
tight O
- O
fitting O
dull O
green O
garment O
which O
, O
together O
with O
a O
brick O
- O
red O
jacket O
or O
vest O
over O
his O
huge O
, O
round O
chest O
, O
gave O
him O
the O
appearance O
of O
a O
grotesque O
turnip O
. O

On O
his O
long O
, O
tapering O
feet O
he O
wore O
flat O
sandals O
held O
in O
place O
by O
thongs O
laced O
through O
the O
ends O
of O
his O
doublet O
, O
if O
I O
may O
call O
it O
that O
. O

His O
fingers O
were O
all O
long O
and O
of O
equal O
length O
, O
and O
he O
kept O
toying O
with O
some O
object O
resting O
in O
his O
lap O
. O

It O
looked O
like O
a O
bassoon O
without O
the O
mouthpiece O
. O

THE O
lights O
had O
now O
reached O
their O
maximum O
, O
giving O
the O
huge O
room O
the O
effect O
of O
being O
flooded O
by O
intensely O
bright O
moonlight O
. O

Behind O
me O
, O
and O
on O
all O
sides O
, O
stood O
scores O
of O
these O
creatures O
, O
similar O
in O
appearance O
to O
the O
Field O
General O
on O
the O
throne O
, O
except O
that O
they O
wore O
dull O
green O
jackets O
instead O
of O
brick O
- O
red O
. O

They O
stood O
motionless O
, O
regarding O
me O
stolidly O
with O
their O
smoldering O
, O
beady O
eyes O
. O

Oomlag B-ORG
stepped O
forward O
and O
saluted O
his O
commander O
with O
a O
sweeping O
motion O
of O
his O
right O
arm O
. O

He O
said O
something O
in O
a O
strange O
, O
guttural O
tongue O
, O
and O
the O
Field O
General O
evidently O
plied O
him O
with O
questions O
about O
me O
, O
for O
they O
kept O
up O
a O
long O
conversation O
, O
often O
glancing O
my O
way O
. O

Finally O
Oomlag B-ORG
turned O
to O
me O
. O

“ O
The O
Field O
General O
wants O
to O
ask O
you O
a O
few O
questions O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
stepping O
to O
one B-CARDINAL
side O
. O

The B-ORG
Field I-ORG
General I-ORG
regarded O
me O
intently O
for O
several O
moments O
. O

I O
quailed O
under O
the O
inspection O
of O
those O
calculating O
, O
cat O
- O
like O
, O
inhuman O
eyes O
of O
his O
. O

The O
only O
difference O
between O
him O
and O
what O
might O
be O
imagined O
in O
a O
nightmare O
was O
that O
he O
was O
the O
real O
thing O
-- O
actual O
and O
horrible O
to O
look O
upon O
. O

With O
his O
loose O
, O
ochre O
lips O
exposing O
the O
sharp O
front O
teeth O
at O
every O
word O
, O
he O
spoke O
in O
a O
pronounced O
guttural O
accent O
, O
his O
English B-LANGUAGE
quite O
limited O
and O
hard O
to O
understand O
. O

“ O
You O
work O
rock O
work O
? O
” O

he O
asked O
with O
difficulty O
. O

“ O
Yes O
, O
sir O
, O
” O
I O
replied O
, O
my O
heart O
pounding O
against O
my O
ribs O
for O
all O
I O
could O
do O
to O
calm O
myself O
. O

“ O
I O
’m O
a O
geologist O
. O
” O

A O
short O
interjection O
by O
Oomlag B-ORG
evidently O
explained O
to O
the O
Field O
General O
what O
a O
geologist O
was O
. O

“ O
You O
know O
then O
what O
is O
r O
- O
r O
- O
radium O
? O
” O

“ O
Yes O
. O
” O

“ O
You O
know O
what O
is O
bismuth O
? O
” O

“ O
Yes O
. O
” O

“ O
You O
know O
any O
in O
between O
? O
” O

“ O
What O
do O
you O
mean O
by O
that O
, O
sir O
? O
” O

I O
inquired O
. O

The O
Field O
General O
spoke O
a O
few O
rapid O
words O
to O
Oomlag B-ORG
, O
who O
said O
to O
me O
: O
“ O
He O
means O
, O
do O
you O
know O
of O
any O
element O
of O
atomic O
weight O
between O
bismuth O
and O
radium O
? O

You O
know O
, O
of O
course O
, O
they O
are O
roughly B-CARDINAL
208 I-CARDINAL
and O
225 B-CARDINAL
, O
using O
16 B-CARDINAL
for O
oxygen O
as O
the O
standard O
, O
and O
I O
promise O
you O
, O
on O
my O
word O
, O
that O
if O
you O
can O
place O
any O
element O
in O
that O
gap O
, O
you O
will O
be O
well O
rewarded O
for O
the O
information O
. O
” O

“ O
There O
has O
been O
none O
discovered O
that O
I O
know O
of O
, O
” O
I O
replied O
. O

“ O
That O
is O
all O
, O
” O
said O
the B-ORG
Field I-ORG
General I-ORG
, O
curtly O
, O
adding O
something O
in O
his O
own O
tongue O
to O
Oomlag B-ORG
. O

Again O
came O
the O
high O
- O
pitched O
humming O
sound O
, O
and O
the O
lights O
dimmed O
perceptibly O
. O

The O
creatures O
round O
about O
, O
who O
had O
regarded O
me O
stolidly O
during O
my O
short O
conversation O
with O
the B-ORG
Field I-ORG
General I-ORG
, O
now O
broke O
up O
into O
little O
groups O
of O
four B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
five B-CARDINAL
and O
walked O
off O
in O
different O
directions O
. O

From O
this O
large O
room O
, O
which O
was O
the O
executive O
chamber O
of O
the B-ORG
Field I-ORG
General I-ORG
, O
branched O
four B-CARDINAL
tunnels O
, O
about B-QUANTITY
twenty I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
in O
height O
and O
the O
same O
in O
width O
, O
lighted O
at O
intervals O
of O
some B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
by O
octagonal O
globes O
, O
set O
in O
niches O
in O
the O
solid O
rock O
and O
projecting O
out O
at O
an O
angle O
of O
45 B-QUANTITY
degrees I-QUANTITY
. O

Down O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
these O
tunnels O
Oomlag B-ORG
now O
bade O
me O
walk O
, O
himself O
striding O
along O
beside O
me O
, O
like O
some O
over O
- O
fantastic O
figure O
in O
a O
parade O
of O
mummers O
. O

We O
had O
only O
gone O
a O
short O
distance O
from O
where O
the O
tunnel O
branched O
from O
the B-ORG
Executive I-ORG
Chamber I-ORG
when O
I O
noticed O
that O
on O
both O
sides O
appeared O
, O
at O
regular O
intervals O
, O
large O
curtains O
or O
hangings O
of O
material O
resembling O
the O
jackets O
these O
people O
wore O
, O
both O
in O
color O
and O
material O
. O

“ O
These O
hangings O
, O
” O
said O
Oomlag B-ORG
, O
in O
the O
same O
way O
a O
guide O
would O
point O
out O
and O
explain O
objects O
of O
interest O
to O
a O
tourist O
, O
“ O
conceal O
doors O
to O
our O
apartment O
houses O
. O

Our O
mode O
of O
life O
is O
practically O
the O
same O
as O
yours O
; O
we O
breathe O
, O
we O
take O
food O
through O
our O
mouth O
, O
we O
require O
shelter O
, O
we O
mate O
, O
we O
are O
gregarious O
. O

The O
apartments O
proper O
I O
am O
not O
permitted O
to O
show O
you O
, O
but O
this O
I O
can O
say O
: O
they O
are O
hewn O
from O
the O
solid O
rock O
, O
as O
are O
all O
these O
tunnels O
, O
by O
our O
own O
machine O
brought O
from O
Venus B-LOC
. O

As O
you O
shall O
probably O
spend O
several B-DATE
years I-DATE
down O
here O
with O
us O
, O
it O
is O
desirable O
that O
you O
should O
have O
this O
preliminary O
trip O
and O
explanation O
before O
you O
are O
assigned O
to O
quarters O
. O

By O
the O
way O
, O
Stan B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
lee I-PERSON
-- O
I O
forgot O
you O
are O
an O
earth O
creature O
and O
subject O
to O
more O
frequent O
pangs O
of O
hunger O
than O
we O
. O

Do O
you O
care O
for O
food O
or O
drink O
? O

It O
is O
only O
a O
short O
distance O
to O
the O
dining O
room O
of O
our O
involuntary O
visitors O
, O
and O
I O
shall O
be O
glad O
to O
take O
you O
there O
before O
we O
go O
further O
. O

What O
do O
you O
say O
? O
” O
EVER O
since O
my O
introduction O
to O
the B-ORG
Executive I-ORG
Chamber I-ORG
, O
I O
had O
wondered O
, O
in O
the O
back O
of O
my O
mind O
, O
where O
my O
fellow O
prisoners O
might O
be O
. O

I O
had O
seen O
no O
living O
thing O
save O
these O
monstrous O
men O
of O
Venus B-LOC
, O
and O
this O
sounded O
like O
a O
chance O
to O
see O
some O
of O
the O
other O
unfortunate O
human O
beings O
held O
captive O
here O
. O

“ O
Yes O
, O
I O
am O
very O
hungry O
, O
Oomlag B-ORG
, O
” O
I O
lied O
, O
“ O
and O
I O
was O
just O
about O
to O
ask O
you O
if O
I O
could O
have O
something O
to O
eat O
. O
” O

“ O
Follow O
me O
. O
” O

I O
followed O
Oomlag B-ORG
down O
this O
main O
tunnel O
about B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
quarter I-CARDINAL
of O
a O
mile O
to O
where O
a O
smaller O
tunnel O
branched O
to O
the O
right O
. O

Some B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
paces O
we O
took O
down O
this O
, O
then O
found O
the O
way O
blocked O
by O
the O
usual O
dull O
- O
green O
hangings O
. O

Oomlag B-ORG
’s O
hands O
reached O
under O
his O
jacket O
, O
there O
was O
a O
rustling O
sound O
, O
and O
instantly O
the O
hangings O
parted O
, O
revealing O
doors O
like O
huge O
square O
blocks O
of O
cement O
. O

These O
doors O
slid O
noiselessly O
into O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
tunnel O
on O
each O
side O
. O

We O
entered O
a O
chamber O
about B-QUANTITY
a I-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
square I-QUANTITY
and O
about B-QUANTITY
fifteen I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
high O
, O
containing O
a B-CARDINAL
dozen I-CARDINAL
large O
, O
round O
tables O
of O
smooth O
rock O
, O
with O
smaller O
stools O
, O
also O
of O
rock O
, O
serving O
as O
chairs O
. O

Over O
each O
table O
, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
the O
comers O
of O
the O
room O
, O
were O
the O
octagonal O
crystal O
lights O
illuminating O
the O
room O
with O
their O
cold O
, O
intense O
rays O
. O

Behind O
us O
the O
immense O
doors O
slid O
together O
again O
without O
a O
sound O
. O

At O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
these O
rock O
tables O
Oomlag B-ORG
and O
I O
seated O
ourselves O
. O

Again O
he O
reached O
under O
his O
jacket O
and O
again O
there O
was O
a O
rustling O
sound O
. O

I O
was O
about O
to O
ask O
him O
what O
sort O
of O
signals O
he O
produced O
by O
this O
mysterious O
maneuver O
, O
when O
a O
panel O
in O
the O
rock O
wall O
at O
the O
far O
end O
of O
the O
room O
slid O
back O
, O
and O
a O
girl O
bearing O
a O
tray O
stepped O
out O
. O

Needless O
to O
say O
, O
I O
regarded O
with O
extreme O
interest O
this O
first B-ORDINAL
person O
of O
my O
own O
race O
I O
was O
privileged O
to O
see O
, O
who O
was O
, O
like O
myself O
, O
a O
captive O
of O
these O
terribly O
efficient O
Venusians B-NORP
. O

Was O
it O
sympathy O
with O
her O
plight O
that O
made O
me O
think O
her O
pretty O
? O

She O
seemed O
of O
a O
Spanish B-NORP
type O
, O
her O
long O
black O
hair O
parted O
smoothly O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
and O
hanging O
in O
glossy O
braids O
on O
either O
side O
of O
her O
pale O
, O
pathetically O
piquant O
face O
. O

She O
was O
clad O
in O
a O
dress O
made O
of O
the O
universal O
material O
used O
by O
these O
people O
, O
reaching O
almost O
to O
her O
ankles O
. O

Though O
she O
was O
small O
, O
the O
garment O
gave O
her O
a O
look O
of O
height O
and O
dignity O
. O

She O
moved O
gracefully O
to O
our O
table O
, O
and O
without O
a O
word O
placed O
before O
us O
the O
dishes O
on O
her O
tray O
. O

As O
she O
leaned O
over O
, O
she O
glanced O
at O
me O
with O
such O
a O
hopeless O
look O
in O
her O
large O
, O
brown O
eyes O
that O
I O
was O
stabbed O
to O
the O
heart O
. O

Before O
she O
turned O
away O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
tear O
rolling O
down O
her O
cheek O
. O

She O
brushed O
at O
it O
with O
a O
slender O
little O
hand O
, O
as O
she O
retired O
with O
the O
empty O
tray O
through O
the O
rock O
panel O
, O
which O
closed O
silently O
behind O
her O
. O

“ O
That O
, O
” O
said O
Oomlag B-ORG
, O
arranging O
the O
dishes O
before O
me O
, O
“ O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
our O
most O
valuable O
guests O
. O

She O
has O
been O
with O
us O
almost B-DATE
five I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
and O
has O
been O
invaluable O
in O
teaching O
us O
Spanish B-LANGUAGE
and O
English B-LANGUAGE
. O

She O
came O
from O
a O
small O
town O
in O
Arizona B-GPE
. O

I O
forgot O
to O
tell O
you O
, O
you O
are O
to O
hold O
no O
converse O
at O
any O
time O
with O
any O
of O
your O
fellow O
beings O
. O

To O
do O
so O
will O
have O
painful O
consequences O
. O

You O
think O
she O
is O
pretty O
, O
do O
n’t O
you O
? O
” O

I O
boiled O
inwardly O
. O

This O
leering O
, O
inhuman O
brute O
was O
my O
absolute O
master O
, O
and O
nothing O
I O
could O
say O
or O
do O
would O
help O
in O
the O
least O
; O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
if O
I O
said O
what O
I O
really O
thought O
, O
it O
would O
be O
the O
worse O
for O
me O
. O

“ O
Oh O
, O
she O
’s O
not O
so O
much O
, O
” O
I O
said O
, O
casually O
. O

“ O
She O
is O
too O
pale O
, O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
. O

Tell O
me O
, O
Oomlag B-ORG
, O
what O
is O
this O
dinner O
you O
have O
ordered O
for O
me O
? O

How O
do O
you O
grow O
anything O
fit O
to O
eat O
down O
here O
? O

What O
is O
this O
soup O
made O
of O
? O
” O

Before O
me O
, O
in O
hollow O
stone O
dishes O
, O
was O
a O
repast O
of O
hot O
soup O
, O
vegetables O
and O
bread O
. O

The O
only O
utensil O
was O
a O
large O
spoon O
made O
of O
some O
sort O
of O
fibre O
. O

“ O
While O
you O
eat O
, O
” O
said O
Oomlag B-ORG
, O
stretching O
his O
long O
legs O
and O
adjusting O
his O
jacket O
, O
“ O
I O
shall O
endeavor O
to O
explain O
things O
to O
you O
. O

Before O
I O
can O
answer O
your O
questions O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
trace O
out O
certain O
other O
things O
. O

Take O
your O
soup O
and O
tell O
me O
what O
you O
think O
of O
it O
. O
” O

I O
did O
so O
, O
finding O
it O
very O
delicious O
, O
rather O
like O
mock O
turtle O
. O

I O
told O
him O
it O
was O
very O
palatable O
. O

“ O
I O
am O
glad O
you O
like O
it O
. O

It O
is O
a O
combination O
of O
crushed O
yucca O
roots O
and O
prairie O
dog O
bones O
, O
prepared O
according O
to O
our O
own O
formula O
. O
” O

I O
made O
a O
wry O
face O
and O
laid O
the O
spoon O
down O
. O

“ O
Ah O
, O
I O
see O
your O
imagination O
tells O
you O
the O
soup O
is O
not O
so O
good O
. O
” O

Oomlag B-ORG
grinned O
horribly O
, O
his O
yellow O
lips O
baring O
his O
sharp O
teeth O
. O

“ O
Strange O
how O
you O
creatures O
allow O
your O
imagination O
to O
dictate O
your O
likes O
and O
dislikes O

If O
I O
had O
not O
told O
you O
the O
ingredients O
of O
that O
soup O

you O
would O
have O
enjoyed O
it O
thoroughly O

Now O
, O
having O
told O
you O
, O
you O
find O
it O
disagreeable O

you O
just O
finished O

might O

long O
had O
the O

was O
to O

the O

No O
doubt O
you O
have O
been O
curious O
to O
know O
why O
the O
Field O
General O
interrogated O
you O
about O
bismuth O
and O
radium O
. O

He O
has O
had O
too O
much O
to O
do O
supervising O
things O
here O
, O
so O
has O
only O
a O
smattering O
of O
your O
languages O
; O
but O
that O
question O
he O
felt O
he O
should O
ask O
you O
personally O
. O

The O
reason O
is O
, O
we O
have O
an O
element O
about B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
- O
way O
in O
the O
atomic O
scale O
between O
bismuth O
and O
radium O
which O
gives O
us O
unlimited O
power O
by O
the O
breaking O
up O
of O
its O
atoms O
. O

We O
know O
that O
this O
element O
does O
exist O
on O
this O
earth O
, O
and O
the O
Field O
General O
thought O
perhaps O
you O
knew O
of O
its O
discovery O
. O

That O
, O
however O
, O
is O
only O
incidental O
, O
and O
not O
the O
reason O
for O
bringing O
you O
here O
. O

“ O
Having O
found O
out O
how O
to O
harness O
this O
element O
, O
we O
were O
well O
supplied O
with O
light O
and O
power O
on O
our O
planet O
. O

These O
lights O
you O
see O
are O
run O
by O
radio O
current O
from O
several O
plants O
in O
our O
workings O
, O
each O
dynamo O
, O
if O
I O
may O
call O
it O
that O
, O
generating O
a O
powerful O
radio O
wave O
which O
is O
caught O
and O
utilized O
by O
each O
of O
these O
crystals O
. O

The O
crystals O
are O
considerably O
larger O
the O
further O
away O
they O
are O
from O
the O
source O
of O
power O
, O
for O
distance O
demands O
more O
filament O
to O
catch O
the O
power O
waves O
. O

“ O
A O
fortunate O
discovery O
, O
though O
with O
tragic O
consequences O
to O
the O
discoverer O
, O
revealed O
the O
possibility O
of O
utilizing O
this O
element O
with O
another O
in O
such O
proportions O
as O
to O
repel O
anything O
in O
front O
of O
the O
wave O
generated O
by O
their O
intermixing O
. O

That O
was O
the O
beginning O
of O
our O
centuries O
of O
work O
on O
an O
interplanetary O
machine O
. O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
if O
the O
ray O
generated O
by O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
elements O
will O
repel O
anything O
in O
its O
path O
, O
then O
by O
proper O
control O
, O
intensifying O
and O
reducing O
it O
at O
will O
, O
enough O
force O
could O
be O
made O
to O
repel O
us O
away O
from O
Venus B-LOC
and O
toward O
the O
earth O
, O
using O
auxiliary O
rays O
to O
repel O
any O
stray O
meteorites O
. O

And O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
those O
. O

But O
the O
exhaustive O
calculations O
! O

Nothing O
could O
be O
left O
to O
chance O
. O

The O
best O
brains O
of O
our O
people O
worked O
ceaselessly O
on O
the O
problem O
until O
everything O
was O
figured O
out O
. O

“ O
I O
do O
not O
think O
it O
is O
of O
much O
use O
to O
try O
to O
explain O
to O
you O
the O
workings O
of O
the O
interplanetary O
machine O
, O
since O
you O
are O
unfamiliar O
with O
the O
element O
responsible O
for O
its O
success O
. O

All O
I O
can O
say O
is O
, O
each O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
combining O
elements O
are O
kept O
in O
finely O
powdered O
form O
in O
separate O
containers O
negative O
to O
their O
power O
as O
lead O
is O
to O
your O
X O
- O
ray O
. O

The O
proper O
amount O
of O
each O
to O
be O
combined O
is O
let O
carefully O
into O
a O
tubular O
apparatus O
, O
separated O
by O
a O
thin O
sheet O
of O
negative O
metal O
which O
is O
then O
withdrawn O
by O
a O
special O
device O
. O

The O
power O
wave O
produced O
by O
the O
resulting O
combination O
is O
carefully O
calculated O
, O
and O
the O
charge O
is O
renewed O
in O
another O
tube O
at O
just O
the O
right O
moment O
. O

A O
battery O
of O
auxiliary O
tubes O
is O
always O
kept O
here O
for O
any O
unexpected O
occurrence O
which O
might O
take O
place O
at O
any O
moment O
. O

“ O
My O
parents O
told O
me O
that O
the O
take O
- O
off O
was O
most O
exciting O
. O

Countless O
thousands B-CARDINAL
of O
my O
fellow O
Venusians B-NORP
were O
crowded O
as O
close O
as O
they O
could O
get O
to O
obtain O
a O
last O
glimpse O
of O
the O
travelers O
. O

At O
exactly O
the O
right O
moment O
, O
the O
big O
projectile O
soared O
slowly O
into O
the O
sky O
, O
gradually O
gaining O
momentum O
as O
it O
left O
the O
stratosphere O
and O
entered O
outer O
space O
. O

Faster O
and O
faster O
it O
went O
, O
with O
its O
meteorite O
detector O
busily O
at O
work O
spotting O
and O
repelling O
these O
menaces O
, O
and O
its O
tubes O
taking O
larger O
and O
larger O
quantities O
of O
the O
precious O
elements O
. O

You O
can O
judge O
for O
yourself O
the O
speed O
they O
attained O
when O
I O
tell O
you O
it O
took O
exactly O
six B-CARDINAL
of O
your O
months B-DATE
for O
my O
people O
to O
get O
here O
. O
” O

“ O
Pardon O
the O
interruption O
, O
” O
I O
said O
, O
munching O
a O
piece O
of O
the O
bread O
that O
tasted O
exactly O
like O
a O
dry O
waffle O
, O
“ O
but O
how O
did O
you O
know O
where O
you O
were O
going O
to O
land O
? O

Suppose O
you O
had O
dropped O
into O
the O
ocean O
, O
or O
even O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
a O
populated O
district O
? O

How O
and O
why O
did O
you O
hit O
this O
part O
of O
New B-GPE
Mexico I-GPE
? O
” O

“ O
That O
is O
explained O
by O
the O
atomic O
telescope O
, O
an O
invention O
of O
my O
great O
- O
great O
- O
grandfather O
’s O
. O

Using O
the O
element O
similar O
to O
radium O
as O
a O
base O
, O
we O
wash O
a O
sensitive O
plate O
with O
this O
certain O
mixture O
containing O
a O
large O
proportion O
of O
that O
element O
. O

In O
order O
to O
save O
time O
, O
let O
us O
call O
this O
element O
‘ O
Venusite B-PERSON
’ O
which O
, O
though O
not O
the O
name O
we O
have O
for O
it O
, O
is O
more O
descriptive O
and O
makes O
it O
easier O
for O
you O
to O
understand O
. O

This O
telescope O
is O
tremendously O
long O
, O
and O
contains O
a O
series O
of O
condensing O
reflectors O
of O
such O
accuracy O
and O
delicacy O
that O
when O
it O
is O
trained O
on O
a O
certain O
spot O
, O
an O
image O
on O
your O
earth O
, O
30,000,000 B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
away O
, O
is O
recorded O
on O
an O
inconceivably O
small O
part O
of O
the O
sensitive O
plate O
. O

This O
plate O
is O
then O
treated O
by O
an O
agent O
which O
causes O
the O
atoms O
in O
the O
‘ O
Venusite B-PERSON
’ O
to O
start O
breaking O
up O
, O
and O
as O
they O
do O
so O
, O
an O
enlarged O
image O
is O
thrown O
on O
a O
screen O
. O

By O
exposing O
various O
parts O
of O
the O
sensitive O
plate O
in O
rapid O
succession O
, O
a O
series O
of O
images O
is O
obtained O
. O

We O
thus O
succeeded O
in O
exploring O
the O
surface O
of O
your O
earth O
thoroughly O
, O
proving O
to O
our O
own O
satisfaction O
that O
we O
could O
not O
only O
live O
on O
your O
planet O
, O
but O
live O
better O
than O
on O
our O
own O
. O

We O
saw O
that O
this O
region O
was O
practically O
uninhabited O
, O
and O
had O
the O
advantage O
of O
possessing O
enormous O
caverns O
suitable O
for O
housing O
us O
. O

It O
remained O
only O
to O
calculate O
the O
proper O
time O
for O
leaving O
in O
order O
to O
hit O
this O
spot O
. O

A O
slight O
error O
put O
my O
people O
several B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
west O
of O
here O
, O
but O
by O
a O
skillful O
handling O
of O
the O
‘ O
Venusite B-PERSON
’ O
they O
managed O
to O
bring O
their O
machine O
down O
by O
the O
entrance O
of O
a O
huge O
limestone O
cave O
. O

The O
rest O
was O
easy O
. O
” O

DURING O
the O
latter O
part O
of O
this O
conversation O
I O
noticed O
that O
Oomlag B-ORG
reached O
under O
his O
jacket O
several O
times O
and O
made O
the O
funny O
rustling O
sounds O
I O
had O
heard O
before O
. O

I O
asked O
him O
what O
he O
was O
doing O
. O

“ O
Oh O
, O
yes O
, O
our O
portable O
wireless O
, O
by O
means O
of O
which O
we O
can O
communicate O
with O
anyone O
else O
in O
the O
workings O
. O
” O

He O
unbuttoned O
his O
jacket O
, O
exposing O
a O
contrivance O
about B-QUANTITY
18 I-QUANTITY
inches I-QUANTITY
square O
at O
the O
base O
, O
with O
a O
dome O
- O
like O
top O
, O
suspended O
from O
his O
shoulders O
and O
held O
in O
place O
by O
a O
strap O
around O
his O
waist O
. O

This O
explained O
the O
pouter O
- O
pigeon O
appearance O
of O
these O
people O
. O

Several O
slits O
about B-QUANTITY
half I-QUANTITY
an I-QUANTITY
inch I-QUANTITY
wide O
radiated O
from O
the O
center O
of O
the O
dome O
, O
and O
from O
these O
slits O
little O
flashes O
of O
light O
darted O
with O
bewildering O
rapidity O
. O

Several O
little O
knobs O
or O
buttons O
protruded O
from O
all O
sides O
of O
the O
square O
base O
, O
and O
these O
Oomlag B-ORG
was O
manipulating O
with O
his O
long O
, O
tapering O
, O
yellow O
fingers O
. O

As O
each O
button O
was O
pressed O
, O
it O
gave O
out O
a O
slight O
, O
crackling O
sound O
. O

“ O
This O
wireless O
apparatus O
, O
” O
continued O
Oomlag B-ORG
, O
pressing O
a O
button O
which O
caused O
the O
little O
flashes O
to O
cease O
, O
“ O
is O
extremely O
simple O
. O

The O
case O
is O
constructed O
of O
a O
metal O
much O
lighter O
than O
your O
aluminum O
, O
and O
in O
it O
is O
housed O
a O
certain O
proportion O
of O
our O
indispensable O
‘ O
Venusite B-PERSON
, O
’ O
in O
containers O
unaffected O
by O
its O
action O
. O

These O
buttons O
on O
the O
right O
release O
certain O
proportions O
of O
‘ O
Venusite B-PERSON
, O
’ O
which O
send O
out O
a O
power O
wave O
depending O
in O
intensity O
on O
the O
mixture O
. O

Other O
buttons O
cut O
off O
the O
wave O
, O
so O
that O
messages O
can O
readily O
be O
sent O
in O
code O
. O

The O
buttons O
on O
the O
left O
are O
used O
to O
tune O
in O
on O
incoming O
messages O
. O

Important O
messages O
are O
assigned O
to O
a O
certain O
wavelength O
, O
controlled O
by O
one B-CARDINAL
button O
which O
is O
always O
plugged O
in O
; O
others O
merely O
vibrate O
, O
and O
as O
each O
individual O
has O
his O
own O
code O
call O
, O
no O
attention O
is O
paid O
to O
other O
messages O
unless O
the O
individual O
gets O
his O
code O
call O
. O

The O
vibration O
of O
the O
apparatus O
against O
our O
chest O
is O
all O
we O
need O
to O
understand O
incoming O
messages O
. O

You O
would O
be O
surprised O
at O
the O
lightness O
of O
these O
vibrations O
. O

If O
you O
had O
the O
thing O
on O
, O
you O
would O
probably O
not O
notice O
them O
at O
all O
. O
” O

By O
this O
time O
I O
had O
finished O
my O
meal O
, O
and O
I O
must O
confess O
that O
I O
enjoyed O
it O
exceedingly O
. O

I O
had O
not O
dared O
to O
ask O
Oomlag B-ORG
what O
the O
vegetables O
were O
, O
after O
learning O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
soup O
. O

They O
tasted O
like O
cauliflower O
and O
artichoke O

Oomlag B-ORG
, O
seeing O
that O
I O
had O
finished O
, O
manipulated O
a O
button O
on O
his O
wireless O
set O
, O
and O
in O
a O
moment O
the O
girl O
appeared O
to O
remove O
the O
dishes O
. O

I O
regarded O
her O
closely O
. O

She O
had O
been O
crying O
bitterly O
, O
for O
her O
eyes O
were O
red O
and O
swollen O
. O

As O
she O
leaned O
past O
me O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
soup O
dish O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
her O
soft O
dark O
braids O
brushed O
my O
cheek O
and O
fell O
into O
my O
lap O
. O

She O
reached O
swiftly O
down O
to O
toss O
the O
offending O
braid O
over O
her O
shoulder O
, O
and O
as O
her O
little O
hand O
hovered O
for O
an O
instant O
over O
mine O
, O
I O
felt O
a O
small O
pellet O
of O
paper O
drop O
into O
my O
open O
palm O

Taking O
advantage O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
was O
momentarily O
between O
me O
and O
Oomlag B-ORG
, O
I O
slipped O
the O
paper O
into O
my O

Silently O
she O
placed O
the O
empty O
dishes O
on O
her O
tray O
and O
, O
without O
looking O
at O

, O
turned O
and O
walked O
swiftly O
out O
of O
the O

through O
the O

Oomlag B-ORG
had O
buttoned O
up O

was O
regarding O

with O
an O
expression O

as O
it O
seemed O

of O
amused O
contempt O

“ O

he O
rasped O

rolling O
his O

back O
into O
a O

“ O

Why O
did O
n’t O
you O
simply O
stay O
on O
the O
surface O
and O
sweep O
all O
opposition O
before O
you O
without O
bothering O
about O
these O
tunnels O
and O
charges O
you O
mention O
? O

I O
’m O
rather O
inclined O
to O
think O
it O
is O
all O
a O
big O
bluff O
, O
and O
your O
‘ O
Venusite B-PERSON
’ O
not O
what O
it O
is O
cracked O
up O
to O
be O
. O

You O
’ve O
proved O
it O
is O
powerful O
, O
all O
right O
, O
but O
there O
would O
n’t O
be O
enough O
of O
it O
to O
do O
all O
the O
things O
you O
say O
. O

You O
could O
n’t O
possibly O
make O
such O
a O
series O
of O
tunnels O
in O
such B-DATE
a I-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O
” O

I O
paused O
for O
breath O
. O

Oomlag B-ORG
was O
busy O
manipulating O
his O
wireless O
contraption O
. O

He O
grinned O
at O
me O
sardonically O
. O

“ O
Show O
me O
! O
” O

I O
continued O
, O
vehemently O
. O

“ O
There O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
we O
humans O
pride O
ourselves O
on O
, O
and O
that O
is O
our O
sense O
of O
logic O
. O

It O
is O
n’t O
logical O
that O
you O
could O
do O
all O
these O
things O
. O

You O
are O
here O
, O
fighting O
for O
a O
toe O
- O
hold O
on O
our O
planet O
, O
afraid O
to O
come O
out O
in O
the O
open O
and O
fight O
. O

Why O
? O

Because O
you O
have O
just O
barely O
managed O
to O
get O
here O
, O
and O
now O
find O
yourselves O
isolated O
with O
no O
means O
of O

, O
and O
unable O
to O
advance O
. O

You O
are O

. O
. O
” O

I O
stopped O
, O
caught O
by O
the O
malevolent O
expression O
in O
Oomlag B-ORG
’s O
eyes O
. O

He O
had O
ceased O
to O
handle O
his O
wireless O
and O
his O
devilish O
grin O
had O
changed O
to O
a O
look O
of O
cold O
hatred O
. O

He O
leaned O
forward O
, O
and O
for O
a O
moment O
I O
feared O
it O
was O
his O
intention O
to O
throttle O
me O
. O

I O
realized O
that O
I O
had O
gone O
too O
far O
with O
my O
bold O
talk O
; O
but O
just O
as O
I O
was O
steeling O
myself O
for O
the O
feel O
of O
his O
terrible O
fingers O
around O
my O
throat O
, O
his O
ochre O
lips O
revealed O
his O
pointed O
teeth O
and O
he O
threw O
back O
his O
head O
with O
a O
guttural O
laugh O
. O

“ O
Your O
sense O
of O
logic O
! O

It O
is O
well O
that O
the O
humor O
of O
your O
remarks O
struck O
me O
, O
for O
I O
might O
otherwise O
have O
choked O
you O
into O
insensibility O
. O
” O

His O
fingers O
drummed O
lightly O
on O
the O
table O
as O
he O
continued O
. O

“ O
Let O
me O
warn O
you O
, O
my O
friend O
, O
never O
again O
to O
talk O
that O
way O
to O
me O
or O
any O
other O
of O
us O
. O

We O
lose O
our O
tempers O
easily O
, O
especially O
when O
a O
slave O
addresses O
his O
master O
as O
you O
have O
done O
. O

But O
you O
are O
new O
here O
and O
I O
shall O
overlook O
it O
this O
time O
. O

“ O
A O
fine O
sense O
of O
logic O
you O
must O
have O
! O

Seeing O
what O
you O
have O
, O
knowing O
what O
you O
do O
, O
to O
think O
that O
we O
would O
be O
at O
the O
end O

Do O
you O
think O
for O
an O
instant O
that O
we O
would O
come O
here O
, O
and O
then O
be O
unable O
to O
return O
to O
Venus B-LOC

defend O

Why O
, O
we O
have O
sufficient O
‘ O

do O
our O

for O
twenty B-DATE

destroy O

send O
the O

back O
to O

with O
the O

What O
a O

you O
are O
, O
you O
poor O
earth O

! O

And O
among O
your O
fellows O
you O
are O
accounted O
wise O

” O

I O
WAS O
too O
elated O
that O
his O
change O
of O
mood O
had O
saved O
me O
from O
the O
consequences O
of O
my O
foolish O
remarks O
to O
feel O
any O
resentment O
at O
his O
description O
of O
my O
mental O
prowess O
. O

I O
grinned O
a O
sickly O
grin O
, O
and O
said O
nothing O
. O

Oomlag B-ORG
rose O
to O
his O
feet O
. O

“ O
Come O
! O
” O

he O
said O
, O
shortly O
. O

“ O
We O
have O
wasted O
enough O
time O
. O

I O
had O
intended O
to O
take O
you O
elsewhere O
first B-ORDINAL

but O
now O
I O
shall O
give O
you O
a O
glimpse O
of O
our O
space O

There O
is O
also O
another O
thing O
I O
wish O
to O
demonstrate O
to O
you O
, O
after O
which O
you O
will O
be O
assigned O

quarters O

Your O
duties O
will O
be O
explained O

” O

Again O
the O
doors O
slid O
back O
and O
we O
were O
once O
more O
in O
the O
large O
hallway O
. O

We O
proceeded O
down O
this O
perhaps O
a B-QUANTITY
half I-QUANTITY
mile I-QUANTITY
, O
passing O
many O
of O
the O
Venusians B-NORP
hurrying O
back O
and O
forth O
, O
emerging O
from O
and O
disappearing O
behind O
the O
hangings O
on O
each O
side O
. O

They O
all O
regarded O
me O
curiously O
, O
but O
without O
hostility O
. O

I O
was O
surprised O
at O
the O
lack O
of O
conversation O
. O

Many O
had O
their O
wireless O
sets O
crackling O
, O
but O
none O
spoke O
to O
each O
other O
or O
to O
Oomlag B-ORG
. O

I O
surmised O
that O
this O
hallway O
was O
the O
main O
residence O
section O
, O
and O
that O
the O
creatures O
we O
passed O
were O
temporarily O
off O
duty O
. O

We O
stopped O
before O
a O
large O
curtain O
covering O
an O
enormous O
section O
of O
the O
left O
wall O
. O

Oomlag B-ORG
gave O
a O
short O
signal O
with O
his O
wireless O
, O
the O
curtain O
parted O
, O
the O
usual O
stone O
doors O
slid O
silently O
open O
, O
and O
we O
entered O
a O
tremendous O
, O
brilliantly O
lighted O
room O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
this O
room O
was O
so O
much O
more O
brightly O
illuminated O
than O
the O
hallway O
, O
that O
it O
took O
me O
several B-TIME
seconds I-TIME
to O
adjust O
my O
eyes O
to O
the O
glare O
. O

As O
I O
stood O
there O
, O
blinking O
, O
Oomlag B-ORG
spoke O
a O
few O
low O
words O
to O
a O
huge O
Venusian B-NORP
who O
, O
I O
noticed O
, O
held O
in O
each O
hand O
a O
long O
, O
cylindrical O
object O
like O
that O
which O
the B-ORG
Field I-ORG
General I-ORG
had O
been O
toying O
with O
. O

As O
I O
grew O
accustomed O
to O
the O
unusual O
brilliance O
, O
I O
took O
in O
the O
details O
of O
this O
astounding O
cavernous O
chamber O
. O

It O
must O
have O
been O
at B-CARDINAL
least I-CARDINAL
five I-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
feet I-CARDINAL
across O
, O
perfectly O
circular O
, O
and O
evidently O
hewn O
from O
a O
natural O
cave O
, O
for O
hundreds B-QUANTITY
of I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
above O
me O
gleamed O
the O
points O
of O
scores O
of O
large O
stalactites O
. O

Around O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
room O
, O
placed O
at O
intervals O
of O
about B-QUANTITY
ten I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
, O
were O
round O
objects O
about O
the O
size O
of O
basketballs O
. O

In O
the O
exact O
center O
of O
this O
mammoth O
cavern O
rested O
a O
huge O
, O
octagonal O
contraption O
with O
a O
rounded O
top O
that O
I O
knew O
must O
be O
the O
interplanetary O
projectile O
itself O
. O

Oomlag B-ORG
tapped O
me O
on O
the O
shoulder O
. O

“ O
Stan B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
lee I-PERSON
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
grinning O
horribly O
, O
“ O
you O
are O
now O
privileged O
to O
inspect O
the O
masterpiece O
of O
our O
civilization O
-- O
the O
space O
flyer O
in O
which O
we O
came O
from O
Venus B-LOC
to O
your O
earth O
. O

Much O
of O
what O
I O
will O
show O
you O
will O
baffle O
your O
intelligence O
, O
but O
it O
will O
give O
you O
an O
idea O
of O
how O
powerful O
we O
are O
. O

This O
machine O
serves O
now O
as O
our O
central O
power O
plant O
. O

See O
those O
tubes O
projecting O
from O
the O
sides O
? O

Half B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
are O
supplying O
power O
to O
those O
round O
transformers O
you O
see O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
transmit O
the O
invisible O
energy O
to O
the O
lights O
in O
the O
various O
rooms O
and O
hallways O
nearby O
. O

Other O
power O
stations O
are O
scattered O
through O
the O
workings O
, O
supplying O
the O
laborers O
with O
the O
light O
which O
increases O
their O
efficiency O
and O
the O
power O
to O
drill O
the O
tunnels O
. O

You O
would O
be O
surprised O
at O
the O
number O
of O
your O
big O
cities O
which O
are O
already O
undermined O
and O
ready O
for O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
in O
which O
we O
strike O
. O

I O
told O
you O
when O
that O
would O
be O
: O
August B-DATE
21 I-DATE
, I-DATE
1931 I-DATE
. O

On O
that B-DATE
day I-DATE
our O
kinsmen O
on O
Venus B-LOC
will O
carefully O
observe O
your O
earth O
, O
and O
will O
witness O
the O
well O

timed O
explosions O
. O

They O
will O
see O
us O
emerge O
; O
they O
will O
see O
-- O
but O
enough O
of O
that O
! O

Come O
! O

I O
will O
show O
you O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
machine O
. O
” O

AS O
we O
approached O
this O
huge O
contrivance O
, O
I O
marveled O
at O
the O
smoothness O
and O
symmetry O
of O
its O
surface O
. O

It O
must O
have O
been O
at B-QUANTITY
least I-QUANTITY
eighty I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
in O
height O
by O
thirty B-CARDINAL
in O
width O
, O
a O
perfect O
octagon O
to O
within O
about B-QUANTITY
fifteen I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
of O
the O
top O
, O
which O
was O
dome O
- O
shaped O
. O

It O
was O
constructed O
of O
something O
that O
looked O
like O
highly O
polished O
gun O
metal O
. O

At O
regular O
intervals O
from O
the O
sides O
projected O
short O
tubes O
arranged O
in O
clusters O
of O
eight B-CARDINAL
, O
which O
Oomlag B-ORG
had O
said O
were O
the O
power O
tubes O
; O
these O
, O
however O
, O
were O
the O
only O
visible O
break O
in O
the O
shining O
surface O
of O
the O
machine O
. O

I O
wondered O
how O
we O
were O
to O
enter O
the O
thing O
. O

That O
question O
was O
soon O
answered O
. O

The O
big O
Venusian B-NORP
who O
had O
admitted O
us O
to O
the O
room O
, O
and O
who O
apparently O
was O
the O
sole O
guardian O
of O
this O
valuable O
chamber O
with O
its O
vital O
apparatus O
, O
stepped O
ahead O
of O
us O
and O
pointed O
one O
of O
the O
round O
objects O
he O
carried O
at O
the O
side O
of O
the O
flyer O
. O

Instantly O
two B-CARDINAL
doors O
flew O
out O
, O
making O
an O
opening O
about B-QUANTITY
four I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
wide O
and O
six B-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
high O
into O
the O
projectile O
. O

Stooping B-PERSON
, O
Oomlag B-ORG
entered O
, O
and O
I O
followed O
close O
behind O
him O
. O

Without O
a O
sound O
, O
the O
doors O
shut O
behind O
us O
. O

At O
last O
I O
was O
actually O
inside O
the O
wonderful O
space O
flyer O
that O
had O
brought O
this O
vanguard O
of O
horrible O
, O
super O
- O
intelligent O
beings O
to O
conquer O
our O
helpless O
earth O
! O

With O
hardly O
controlled O
excitement O
and O
curiosity O
I O
gazed O
around O
. O

We O
were O
standing O
in O
a O
brilliantly O
lighted O
octagonal O
chamber O
some O
twenty B-QUANTITY
- I-QUANTITY
five I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
across O
, O
with O
a O
metallic O
ceiling O
about B-QUANTITY
twelve I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
from O
the O
floor O
. O

In O
the O
center O
of O
this O
ceiling O
was O
a O
circular O
opening O
about B-QUANTITY
six I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
in O
diameter O
through O
which O
extended O
a O
round O
, O
perpendicular O
shaft O
like O
the O
slide O
pole O
in O
a O
fire O
station O
. O

On O
each O
side O
, O
opposite O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
chamber O
, O
were O
tall O
metal O
devices O
, O
for O
all O
the O
world O
like O
elongated O
hour O
glasses O
, O
extending O
from O
floor O
to O
ceiling O
. O

On O
the O
neck O
of O
each O
was O
an O
intricate O
series O
of O
valves O
and O
pipes O
, O
and O
from O
the O
base O
of O
each O
“ O
hour O
glass O
” O
innumerable O
small O
tubes O
led O
to O
the O
walls O
. O

Although O
I O
could O
n’t O
hear O
a O
sound O
, O
I O
seemed O
to O
be O
conscious O
of O
a O
sort O
of O
vibration O
that O
made O
me O
sense O
the O
powerful O
forces O
that O
were O
at O
work O
. O

At O
the O
base O
of O
the O
pole O
in O
the O
center O
was O
a O
round O
platform O
which O
, O
as O
I O
looked O
, O
slid O
noiselessly O
out O
of O
sight O
up O
the O
pole O
, O
descending O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
seconds I-TIME
with O
a O
couple O
of O
Venusians B-NORP
. O

These O
, O
after O
a O
curious O
glance O
at O
me O
, O
busied O
themselves O
inspecting O
the O
machinery O
, O
reading O
dials O
, O
and O
moving O
various O
handles O
on O
the O
different O
valves O
. O

Oomlag B-ORG
had O
been O
watching O
me O
with O
smug O
satisfaction O
, O
evidently O
deriving O
much O
amusement O
from O
my O
open O
- O
mouthed O
expression O
of O
amazement O
. O

“ O
Yes O
, O
I O
thought O
you O
would O
be O
entertained O
by O
this O
little O
visit O

he O
chuckled O

“ O

you O
can O
imagine O

what O

open O
. O

Oomlag B-ORG
scowled O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
be O
considering O
what O
he O
had O
just O
heard O
. O

He O
cast O
a O
glowering O
, O
sidelong O
glance O
in O
my O
direction O
, O
and O
I O
guessed O
that O
I O
must O
be O
concerned O
in O
some O
way O
. O

Finally O
, O
he O
said O
something O
curtly O
to O
the O
guard O
, O
and O
faced O
me O
. O

I O
was O
relieved O
to O
see O
his O
face O
light O
up O
into O
a O
grin O
which O
, O
though O
evil O
and O
hideous O
, O
was O
a O
grin O
nevertheless O
. O

“ O
We O
shall O
step O
outside O
a O
moment O
, O
Stan B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
lee I-PERSON
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O

“ O
I O
have O
some O
important O
news O
for O
you O
which O
should O
make O
you O
feel O
pretty O
good O
. O
” O

Wondering O
what O
he O
could O
possibly O
mean O
by O
this O
, O
I O
followed O
Oomlag B-ORG
and O
the O
guard O
out O
of O
the O
flyer O
into O
the O
intense O
light O
of O
the O
large O
cavern O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
the O
doors O
had O
swung O
shut O
behind O
us O
, O
Oomlag B-ORG
spoke O
. O

“ O
The O
Field O
General O
has O
commanded O
that O
you O
be O
released O
! O
” O

I O
gasped O
with O
amazement O
. O

Surely O
, O
there O
must O
be O
some O
mistake O
! O

Released O
, O
knowing O
what O
I O
did O
about O
their O
plans O
, O
free O
to O
take O
steps O
to O
stamp O
out O
this O
menace O
, O
to---- O
“ O
Stan B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
lee I-PERSON
, O
I O
see O
you O
are O
incredulous O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
you O
are O
to O
be O
released O
, O
immediately O
. O
” O

Oomlag B-ORG
came O
closer O
, O
leering O
into O
my O
face O
. O

“ O
The O
Field O
General O
has O
a O
sense O
of O
humor O
, O
just O
as O
we O
all O
have O
. O

It O
is O
really O
our O
one B-CARDINAL
weakness O
. O

He O
feels O
your O
presence O
here O
is O
undesirable O
, O
and O
your O
services O
are O
not O
needed O
after O
all O
. O

That O
leaves O
two B-CARDINAL
alternatives O
-- O
either O
kill O
you O
, O
or O
let O
you O
go O
. O

He O
has O
decided O
on O
the O
latter O
. O

Myself O
, O
I O
am O
sorry O
, O
for O
I O
have O
taken O
a O
liking O
to O
you O
. O
” O

I O
was O
stunned O
. O

Like O
a O
fool O
I O
blurted O
out O
: O
“ O
But O
-- O
but O
, O
you O
have O
shown O
me O
-- O
how O
do O
you O
dare---- O
” O

“ O
I O
know O
what O
you O
think O
. O
” O

Oomlag B-ORG
spoke O
suavely O
, O
mockingly O
. O

“ O
You O
think O
that O
, O
once O
free O
, O
you O
will O
spread O
the O
alarm O
to O
your O
fellows O
. O

How O
ridiculous O
! O

In O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
, O
no O
one O
would O
believe O
you O
, O
you O
would O
be O
considered O
mad O
. O

In O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
place O
, O
you O
humans O
could O
do O
nothing O
to O
hinder O
us O
if O
you O
wished O
. O

We O
have O
the O
power O
of O
‘ O
Venusite B-PERSON
. O
’ O

I O
need O
say O
no O
more O
. O

It O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
jokes O
I O
ever O
heard O
! O

You O
alone O
of O
the O
earth O
inhabitants O
will O
know O
of O
our O
existence O
, O
and O
your O
knowledge O
will O
be O
useless O
. O

You O
can O
do O
nothing O
, O
absolutely O
nothing O
. O

Your O
friends O
will O
discover O
you O
, O
wandering O
. O

A O
word O
of O
this O
to O
anyone O
-- O
well O
, O
your O
mind O
has O
been O
wandering O
, O
too O
! O
” O

I O
was O
sickened O
by O
his O
fiendish O
, O
throaty O
laughter O
as O
he O
derided O
me O
, O
mocked O
me O
with O
this O
terrible O
truth O
. O

Suddenly O
his O
manner O
changed O
. O

The O
leer O
on O
his O
face O
was O
replaced O
by O
an O
ugly O
snarl O
of O
determination O
. O

He O
uttered O
a O
few O
words O
in O
his O
own O
language O
, O
and O
I O
felt O
myself O
seized O
from O
behind O
. O

Oomlag B-ORG
’s O
ochre O
face O
came O
close O
to O
mine O
. O

“ O
Goodbye O
, O
earth O
creature O
. O

You O
go O
out O
the O
way O
you O
came O
! O
” O

Again O
I O
felt O
myself O
blindfolded O
and O
gagged O
, O
rapidly O
losing O
consciousness O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
the O
sweetish O
drug O
. O
. O
. O

The O
rest O
can O
be O
told O
in O
a O
few O
words O
. O

I O
regained O
consciousness O
not O
far O
from O
the O
camp O
- O
site O
. O

The O
sun O
was O
high O
in O
the O
heavens O
. O

I O
staggered O
to O
where O
I O
had O
seen O
the O
rock O
camouflage O
. O

It O
was O
not O
there O
-- O
absolutely O
no O
sign O
of O
any O
disturbance O
, O
nothing O
but O
ordinary O
flat O
ground O
. O

Something O
made O
me O
think O
of O
the O
note O
I O
had O
received O
from O
the O
dark O
- O
haired O
girl O
. O

I O
found O
it O
where O
I O
had O
stuffed O
it O
in O
my O
pocket O
. O

In O
a O
hasty O
scrawl O
she O
had O
written O
, O
in O
charcoal O
, O
now O
scarcely O
legible O
: O
“ O
India B-GPE
is O
safe O
. O
” O

The O
sun O
was O
setting O
when O
Olin B-PERSON
appeared O
with O
a O
posse O
in O
search O
of O
me O
. O

I O
trumped O
up O
an O
explanation O
of O
how O
I O
had O
been O
restless O
, O
had O
gone O
for O
a O
ride O
in O
the O
moonlight O
, O
had O
been O
thrown O
from O
the O
horse O
. O
. O
. O

what O
else O
could O
I O
do O
? O

It O
was O
as O
Oomlag B-ORG
had O
said O
. O

Now O
, O
in O
India B-GPE
, O
I O
write O
these O
lines O
. O

The O
girl O
must O
have O
thought O
I O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
get O
free O
. O

My O
friends O
, O
for O
God O
’s O
sake O
do O
not O
regard O
me O
as O
a O
second O
Jack B-PERSON
Pansay I-PERSON
with O
his O
phantom O
“ O
rickshaw O
. O
” O

* O

Olin B-PERSON
knows O
I O
disappeared O
-- O
and O
I O
know O
what O
happened O
. O

If O
I O
am O
not O
spared O
to O
read O
this O
document O
myself O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
those O
who O
will O
believe O
, O
give O
it O
circulation O
. O

How O
wise O
was O
Shakespeare B-PERSON
when O
he O
had O
Hamlet B-WORK_OF_ART
say O
: O
“ O
There O
are O
more O
things O
in O
Heaven O
and O
earth O
. O
. O
. O
” O

I O
can O
say O
no O
more O
. O
