On January 14, 1923, Olin Gilfillan (my most trusted field lieutenant and a brilliant, hard-working man) and I set out on horseback from Lovington, New Mexico, and headed toward the Mescalero Ridge. We had with us a couple of pack mules bearing camping equipment and grub for a week. It was our intention to scout the southeast part of the Ridge, and report certain findings to the company. I shall not here relate any technical description of our route, inasmuch as my complete report is on file with the company in their Chicago office.
